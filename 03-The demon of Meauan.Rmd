The demon of Meauán

Hanahpú and Ixbalanqué went into the forest and built a giant crab made of stones and branches, knowing Zipacná's predilection for crabmeat. For the legs they used _pahac_, for the eyes they used coals from the fire, and for the carapace they used a large, flat stone. Then they lifted the stone contraption onto their backs and carried it to the foot of the mountain called Meauán, where they would defeat Zipacná once and for all.

As they marched along, Ixbalanqué strained his neck to regard the contraption from beneath the little carapace of shoulder blades, and frowned.

"This doesn't look like a crab," he said. "It looks like a turtle."

The two brothers ensconced the stone, turtle-looking crab contraption at the river's edge, and then hid in the brush higher up the bank.

"Now, surely, Zipacna will be lured to the water's edge by our stone crab," said Hanahpu, "and we shall leap upon him with our spears."

Just then, Zipacna appeared behind them, on his way down to the river to hunt crabs.

"How now, my friends?" he saluted, "What brings you to Meauán today?"

"Ah!" cried out Hanahpu, "we've come to trap a demon who frequents these waters to hunt for...turtles."

"Yes, yes," joined in Ixbalanqué, "we built a stone turtle and placed it at the water's edge to lure him out. As soon as he appears, we will leap upon him with our spears!"

Zipacna held his hand to his brow and scanned the river bank, spotting their sculpture. One of the burning coals used for the eyes had fallen onto the sandy bank.

"A demon?" responded Zipacna, "Well, as I am god of these parts, I shall help you!" And he crouched in the brush with Hanahpu and Ixbalanqué, waiting in ambush for the demon of Meauán.

They waited and waited, and as they waited Zipacna grew hungry; and the hungrier he grew, the more the stone, one-eyed turtle began to look like a succulent, one-eyed crab.

"Maybe the demon has not been lured because of the eye. We shall fix it."

And they went down to the river and picked the burning coal off the sand and lodged it under the stone carapace.... Watching from their hiding place higher up the bank, Zipacna could not decide whether they were demons or men.... he went down to the sand and slew the two men. In this way, the brothers Hanahpú and Ixbalanqué slew the demon of Meauán.
















“That way,” responded Hanahpú, “if Zipacná comes upon us as we head to the mountain he will not suspect we are laying an ambush.”
Just then, Zipacná met them in the forest.
“Where are you going with that big stone turtle?” asked Zipacná.
“We intend to lure a certain demon into an ambush.  We happen to know that the demon has a predilection for turtle meat.  He will be unable to resist this delicacy and will fall into the trap.  Where are you headed, Lord Zipacná?”
“I was headed for the river to catch crabs.  A demon?  Well, I am the lord of these mountains, so I will help you attack this demon, and then catch crabs later,” responded Zipacná.
“Thank you Zipacná, but that is unnecessary.  We will do it ourselves.”
“If there is a demon terrorizing these mountains then it is my duty to kill it.  Show me where the demon is hiding.  My lunch can wait.”
Hanahpú and Ixbalanqué looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders beneath the weight of the large stone crab.
They led Zipacná to the foot of the mountain called Meauán, carrying the stone crab on their backs.  When they reached the foot of the mountain they set down the stone crab and waited.
Eventually Zipacná could no longer tolerate his hunger and left for the river.  Hanahpú and Ixbalanqué caught up with him and said, “Lord Zipacná, did you say it was crabs you were hunting?”
“Yes!  Why do you ask?”
“We just saw a giant crab near the foot of the mountain called Meauán.  Quick, run and catch it before it gets away!”
Zipacná was thus tricked into the ambush and defeated by Hanahpú and Ixbalanqué.

The 400 brothers had been building their house and needed a long beam to support the roof.  They found a suitable tree and felled it.  Zipacná saw the 400 brothers carrying a giant log on their backs and watched for his opportunity.  When they foundered on the banks of the river he came down to help them.
“Who are you?” asked the 400 brothers.
	“I am Zipacná, lord of these mountains.  I will help you carry this log.”
	“Thank you,” said the 400 brothers.
	Zipacná plucked the log from their hands and carried it the rest of the way.  When they reached the site where the 400 brothers were building their house, he fit the beam in its place on the roof.
	“Thank you,” said the 400 brothers.  But as Zipacná walked off, the 400 brothers turned to each other with astonished expressions and said, “Zipacná, lord of these mountains, lifted the log onto the roof all by himself.  Let’s dig a giant hole and invite him to our banquet tonight.  When the moment comes, we shall ambush him and kill him.”
	The 400 brothers caught up with Zipacná and invited him to their banquet.
Then they dug a deep hole in the ground, right in the middle of their house.
When Zipacná arrived for the banquet, the 400 brothers threw him into the hole and buried him there.
They lit a bonfire atop the grave and began to celebrate.  No one noticed the little trails of ants winding between their dancing feet, carrying off bits of bone, hair, and fingernails.  When all of the pieces of Zipacná’s body were exhumed in this way, Zipacná rose up behind them and cast the roof beam on top of them, slaying them all.
	When Hanahpú and Ixbalanqué heard that Zipacná had killed the 400 brothers by making the roof-beam collapse onto their heads, they were determined to kill Zipacná.  They went into the forest and built a giant crab made of stones and branches.
