Clouds and mountains.  Indeed, it was truly unfortunate to state things in such a pedantic way.
The colors scatter.  The appearance of linear-consecutive order is just a ruse!
	“The Jade Maiden!”
Fong Tak drew his sword and lunged after her—the iron broom swept low.  The Jade Maiden retreats two or three steps, gathering the moon from the forest pool.  Nets of arrays of countless striking moves appearing in all reflections—although the moon is one, at night it can reflect on countless lakes and pools of water.  This means that a former image is reflected in present circumstances.  The flight from a steep precipice, the hand shaped like a snake-shaped blade.  Is it the strike or the feint?  The swallow steps to the side, eager to guard autumn composure.  Finger fan strike to the eyes.  Diamond fist in the gusty mere.  Fong Tak fights against sinew dislocations.  This means: the central essence has been revealed indirectly, in peripheral forms.  Arrays of nets of countless strikes of lakes and pools of water.  The Jade Maiden ducks, then lashes out—the corrugated edge of her painted fan smarts the knuckles.  She feints, then executes: Countless fringes of shadow.  Only her eyes are visible above the taut green veil covering her lips.
All of the Jade Maiden’s spinning obstructions arrive at the same time.  Nonetheless, Fong Tak smashes the coffin to pieces.
They shot upwards through the autumn boughs like two arrows.
Fong Tak’s velocity was slightly greater than the Jade Maiden’s.  The beveled tip of his sword came closer and closer to the taut veil that covered her lips.  Above the veil: two hazel eyes welling up with tears, harder and harder to see in the fading autumn light.
“Who are you!” he cries, “Why have you come to Mount Song!”
	“I bring a warning,” replied the Jade Maiden.
	“What warning?”
“The Shaolin monastery will be destroyed.”
“Impossible!”
“A rogue monk named Bai Mei will betray Shaolin to the Qing.”
Gongs and mallets in the distance: Hmmm, the light is fading, and still no one knows who is guest and who is host.  Lo, the day—it has passed Fong Tak by again without his hardly knowing it!  Only the eyes of the Jade Maiden are visible above her taut silk veil.  And now, you could almost not see their hazel color.  Fong Tak had propelled himself off the ground with greater force than the Jade Maiden had; the beveled tip of his sword came closer and closer to the taut outline of the Jade Maiden’s lips pressed against the silk fabric of the veil.  Above the veil: hazel irises that sparkled glowed, catching pools of amber in the horizontal rays of dying light.  The Jade Maiden snapped open her fan.  Fong Tak averted his gaze, knowing the colors and images painted thereon would throw his attack into disarray.  He honed his concentration on the signs at the periphery of their movement—stirring leaves, the sensation of air passing over the skin, stirring eddies and vortices, the odor of oak and sassafras fires in the distance—disaggregating the self-notion, spreading the consciousness faculty to the extremities, the hands, the feet, the surrounding trees.  _First, atmospheres of self-awareness arising.  Then, thoughts transcending the circuit of non-self awareness, forming the insight “although there are pugilistic forms interchanging, leaves stirring, and air passing over the skin, although there is the sensation of an ‘I’ and an ‘opponent,’ exchanging pugilistic forms, an internal and external world, in fact none of it is actually there.”_

Fong Tak was on the ground, seated in the lotus position, gongs and mallets echoing through the forest. "I am in the painting," he mused, drawing his meditation to a close.[ All of the apparent sparring had only been ink, pigment, and parchment, rendered with such exquisite skill that Fong Tak had mistaken it for reality.]

[“You must be capable of looking into the autumn portrait without losing yourself in it!” came the Taoist Immortal’s rebuff from behind Fong Tak’s shoulder.]
In the distance: gongs and wooden mallets.

_Thus is the mind of desire.  Its objects are not real._
_The goddesses of incomparable beauty of the Thirty-three-fold Heaven are ninety-two trillion in number, for example.  They reside in Indra’s palace, on Mount Sumeru, reclined upon divans of banks of sapphire flames emitting fragrant beams of light in chambers of countless arrays of diaphanous curtains of light reflecting off of fountains made of the amorous gazes of celestial maidens.  These gazes of amorous maidens, moreover, by the power of the ocean of verities of their past vows, and by the fruits of their constantly sporting, constantly forming perfect jatika, sumana, patala, and campaka jewel flower-mudras at the center of their breasts, always give rise to the perfect gradations of translucency of prehensile fabrics shifting across the goddesses’ bodies, like light reflecting off of palatial fountains—perfect in their degrees of coalescence, degrees of correct protuberance of ripples, correct degrees of light glinting off of their irises, and correct arrays of draping hair._

_The jewel-adorned curtains of translucent laces and silks of the chambers of the goddesses are, moreover, made of the curtains of light reflecting off of the palatial fountains in Indra’s courtyard, in which children are playing. Fong Tak took his place among the other monks and nuns in the meditation hall, drawing on deep atmospheres of equanamous thought. A sound of children’s laughter from over the wall of the courtyard. The probationary novices were playing and sparring on the other side._

_The mind of desire is the mind of illusion, thought Fong Tak, beginning the meditation on desire, Like any optical trick it can be dispelled. These arrays of fragrant banks of sapphire flames of the divans of goddesses of the Thirty-three fold Heaven, networks of chambers of goddesses, diaphanous and translucent, separated by silk fabrics, curtains, and veils, in turn composed of networks of chimes intoning harmonic resonances, networks of arrays of colors of a vermillion-gold color shifting to a pearly mauve, arrays of open windows through which the amorous gazes of goddesses of the Thirty-three fold Heaven fall onto fountain pools and networks of canopies of falling blossoms of mudras of pure light, arrays of pools of amber light in hazel eyes, different arrays of the diaphanous aural curtains of children’s laughter, rising up from the palatial fountains below, different arrays of the amorous gazes of goddesses beholding enlightened milieus of children playing in the palatial fountains of Indra’s courtyard below, which let through, moreover, a glimpse of the other faceted curtains, veils, and fragrant drapes of radiant jewel-eye patterns that lay beyond, each of which are rendered with such exquisite skill that they cannot be distinguished from reality, founded as they are upon the same number of pattern-forming cadences of oceans of varying degrees of autumn light collecting into pools of amber on the hazel irises of goddesses of the Thirty-three fold Heaven, varying degrees of autumn light reflecting off of drapes of black hair, varying degrees of autumn light changing  from a vermillion gold color to a pearly mauve color, or a pearly mauve color blending into a golden sapphire color, are, moreover, just as diaphanous and transluscent as the celestial fabrics that slide across the persimmon hues of the goddesses’ bodies, revealing the other faceted curtains, veils, and fragrant drapes of radiant jewel-eye patterns that lay beyond, each of which are rendered with such exquisite skill that they cannot be distinguished from reality._

_How so?  All of the goddesses in the Thirty-three-fold Heaven have ten thousand kinds of rays of autumn sunlight that strike their hazel irises at an oblique angle from the west, at the hour of sunset, from between poignant vermillion slats of clouds, made from ten thousand kinds of drapes of black hair turned a golden-sapphire color in the autumn sunlight through which rays of autumn light are sifting and striking the hazel irises of the goddesses’ eyes, each one composed of ten thousand kinds of a pearly mauve color shifting to a golden sapphire color on the surface of black drapes of hair falling across the temples to shade the eyes from the westward striking rays of autumn sunlight, which are made from ten thousand kinds of arrays of networks of upward turning hazel eyes that look up just then, catching a glint of the autumn sunlight that sifts through the drapes of black hair turning a pearly sapphire mauve color just then._

_Thus is the mind of desire. There is a danger of staying there because its objects are not real.  Although the images of jewel adorned goddesses are just products of my imagination, conjured up as a meditation exercise, they are by this very fact even more real; for it is the mark of the objects of desire that they are not real._

_Breathing in—these adornments of rays of autumn sunlight are in turn composed of countless adornments of arrays of splinters of amber light forming on hazel irises like pools of rainwater collecting on lips of cairns and stupas, which are themselves derived of countless, unspeakably many adornments of pattern-forming cadences of poignant vermillion slats of clouds at sunset, which are in turn constituted by countless, unspeakably, incalculably many adornments of radiant drapes of black hair turned a sapphire pearly mauve color in the autumn light, all of which constantly change, multiply, and fill space without dispersing._

_Some of the goddesses have their hair held high in jewel nets of infinite radiant jewel eyes, while others leave it flowing down their nape and temples allowing it to catch different rays of autumn sunlight. Some of the goddesses’ waists are ringed with strings of pearls, agates, and sapphires, while other goddesses' waists are adorned in different celestial arrays of perfumed silks and lace. Some of the hems of their celestial brocades are adorned with countless amethysts, diamonds, sumana, campaka, and patala flowers, fruit of the mudra of the celestial maidens who are sporting at that moment on the seven celestial lakes, serving all goddesses of the Thirty-three-fold Heaven, in turn composed of ten thousand kinds of curtains of laughter of celestial maidens weaving like light reflecting off of palatial fountains in which children are playing. By the permutative aspect of past attainments of roots of goodness the showers of laughter of celestial maidens were countless thousands of billions in number; and the combinatoria of permutations of details of aesthetic combinations of sumana, campaka, and patala flowers was infinite._

_How so? These substances are an extension of the array of radiant jewel-eye brocades adorning the hems of the goddess’ celestial fabrics. All of the goddesses, moreover, have ten thousand kinds of a vermillion gold color turning to a pearly mauve color on their hair, or ten thousand kinds of shades of a pearly mauve color on their hair blending into a golden sapphire color. These adornments of shades of pearly mauve colors of autumn sunlight blending into a golden sapphire color are in turn composed of countless adornments of ten thousand shades of hazel irises catching the rays of light, which are in turn composed of countless, incalculably many diadems of ten thousand distinct arrays of pools of rainwater collecting on the lips of cairns and stupas like pools of amber light collecting on hazel irises at the hour of sunset, which are in turn derived of countless, incalculably, unspeakably many adornments of pattern-forming, fractal cadences of poignant vermillion slats of clouds at sunset, which are in turn composed of countless adornments of curtains of amorous gazes of goddesses reclined upon divans in radiant jewel flower adorned palaces, adornments of sounds of children playing in fountains, adornments of upward gazing and downward gazing hazel irises of eyes of goddesses of incomparable beauty, adornments of open windows through which the various gazes of the goddesses are gazing and viewing pleasant scenes, and various scenes of adornments of vermillion sapphire colors of hair turning a pearly mauve color at sunset, all of which constantly merge, multiply, and fill space without dispersing, resting as they do on the ocean of refracting patterns of combinatoria of adornments of infinite pattern-forming cadences of disperse atmospheres of cadences of verities, adorned with ten thousand kinds of fractal pathways of disperse atmospheres of oceans of diamond-facets of verities of upward turning hazel eyes, made of ten thousand kinds of pools of amber light collecting on hazel irises like rainwater that collects on the lip of a cairn or stupa._

_Although the images of jewel adorned goddesses of pattern-forming cadences of westward-striking rays and eastward striking rays of autumn light at sunset caught in pools of amber light on the hazel iris of her eye or of the on jets of black hair are mere figments of my imagination conjured up as a meditation exercise, they are by this very fact even more real; for the mark of the objects of desire is the mark of not being real.  That they are not real—that is the whole point._

_Indra goes to all of the goddesses, ninety-two trillion in number, having intercourse with them all, and yet causing each one to think that he is with her alone. How so? Indra knows that the mark of the mind of desire is its non-existence. In going to one chamber, he goes to all the chambers of the palace. The temple acolyte also goes from candle to candle, extinguishing the ardor of each. Just as each flame is of the essential nature of fire and has no concept of separate candles with separate flames, Indra cannot go to a single chamber without going to them all. In each chamber, morevor, there is a goddess of incomparable beauty reclined upon a divan of sapphire banks of refracting networks of jewel-flames, who transfixes him in her gaze and says:_

_"My body is the palace of Indra on Mount Sumeru, abode of all of the goddesses of the Thirty-three-fold Heaven, ninety-two trillion in number, each one reclined upon a divan in a chamber of countless kinds of jewel-adorned arrays of networks of radiant jewel flowers. You must not go to just one or two of the chambers of this palace, but to them all, calming the ardor of each goddess within."_

_In the same way, Indra cannot go to just one or two of the goddesses, but in going to one, must go to them all. Were Indra to go to just one or two of the goddesses, hoping to impress them with his devotion to them alone, the goddesses would sense something false in his caress and would recede._

_Some of the hems of the lace and silk fabrics that adorn their bodies are made of ten thousand kinds of rays of autumn sunlight reflecting off of fountain pools in which children are playing, the upward reflecting light entering the open windows of jewel-adorned goddesses' chambers and causing various diaphanous light-curtains to appear on the ceiling, made of open windows of goddesses' chambers through which upward reflecting light is reflecting. Some of the hems of the lace and silk brocades covering the goddesses’ bodies are made of ten thousand kinds of a vermillion-saffron color changing to a pearly lavender color on black jets of hair caused by rays of autumn sunlight at sunset, composed in turn of open windows of palatial goddesses' chambers through which clouds and birds are visible, or through which a fragrant autumn breeze can be felt. Some of the jewel-flower hems of the garments covering the goddesses' waists are made of open palatial windows of the goddesses' chambers through which the amorous gazes of jewel-adorned goddesses reclined in translucent chambers of Indra’s palace are flowing, made in turn of different pools of amber light collecting on hazel eyes, like rainwater collecting on the lip of a cairn or stupa. Their bodies flow beneath as many kinds of translucent canopies of silk and lace as there are atoms in ten billion Buddha fields of worlds, like forest brooks beneath the mottled half-light of canopies of autumn leaves, opaque here, twinkling in the sunlight there, in accordance with the loving wish of the celestial maidens who serve all goddesses of the Thirty-three fold Heaven._

_How so? All of the goddesses in the Thirty-three-fold Heaven are constantly forming, by virtue of their former vows, seven sacred lakes at the corners of their eyes. On each sacred lake there are, by virtue of the past body of verities of accumulated dedications, seven lotus blossoms. Thereupon the seven celestial maidens sport and play, their bodies lithe and delightful, clad always in the translucent jewel-eye fabrics of correct mudra formation as the result of the accumulation of infinite treasure stores of insights and liberation doors, they cause various downpours of celestial flowers to fall across the seven sacred lakes at the corners of the goddesses' eyes, producing countless appropriate forms of amorous gazes, parted lips, curtains of light falling through open windows, pools of amber light collecting on hazel eyes, sounds of children playing in fountains, and magenta-golden colors of hair shifting to a pearly lavender color at sunset, from which the angles and degrees of translucence and tautness of celestial lace and silk fabrics shifting across the skin of the goddesses' bodies is composed. The movements and thoughts of the celestial maidens are always in tune with the movements and thoughts of the goddesses. They dance and sport on their lotus blossoms, forming their hands into appropriate auspicious mudra which cause the various appropriate showers of blossoming patala flowers, campaka flowers, mandarava flowers, maha-mandarava flowers, blossoming sumana flowers, manjushaka flowers, maha-manjushaka flowers, blossoming jatika flowers, and so forth, to fall across the seven sacred lakes at the corners of the goddesses' eyes and thus fashion the appropriate arrays of angles and degrees of translucence of hems of silks and broccades of lace that cover the goddesses’ bodies, depending on the mudra that is formed by their hands. These celestial fabrics, thus fashioned out of correct ethers of autumn sunlight and loving thought, immediately coalesce across the bodies of the goddesses like light on ripples of water, in appropriate degrees of translucence, friction, and prehensility, just by the loving wish of the celestial maidens._

_How so? Should a goddess incline to the right, for example, the seven celestial maidens, dancing and sporting on their respective lotus blossoms, on their respective sacred lakes, immediately know of the goddess' inclining to the right, and even in the midst of their respective dancing and sporting they instantly cause the appropriate forms, angles, frictions, undulations, and degrees of translucence of celestial fabrics sliding across the right-inclining body of the goddess to appear across her body in a lithe and pleasing display, because they are always in tune with, are not separate from the minds of the goddesses. Their dancing and sporting, their correct mudra formation, is not separate from the right-inclining body of the goddess, nor from her parted lips, nor from her amorous gaze, nor from the appropriate forms of coalescence of celestial silks and laces across her body, nor from the correct protuberance, correct prehensility of labia that are concealed beneath the veil._

_Thus is the arising of the mind of desire. There is a danger of remaining there because its objects are not real._











Abbot Chi Thien Su had sent Fong Tak to the charnel grounds to mortify the senses through the meditation on the disintegration of the body.
	Fong Tak continued on to the charnel grounds and sat down before one of the pyres.
The nature of physicial beauty is the nature of transience and decay.  Attachment to carnal beauty is based on ignorance of this fundamental nature.
Fong Tak drew on deep atmospheres of knowledges of impermanence, observing as the corpses were brought up from the river and laid across the pyres, dwelling on the stench of putrefaction, observing the different gradations of decay of the dead.
Some of the corpses were bloated and speckled with disease, some of the corpses were gouged with unnatural wounds or were missing limbs; there were corpses whose eyes were closed, corpses whose eyes were open, or which had one closed eye and one open eye, corpses that seemed only to be asleep, corpses that had been taken in the flower of their youth, almost indistinguishable from living souls, there were the corpses of adolescent girls with breasts that flounced like petticoats as they were brought up from the river, corpses of young men with fists and teeth clenched, corpses of old men and women, corpses with outstretched hands that dangled like handkerchiefs of adieu!  There were corpses with expressions contorted by the pain and confusion of their last moments, corpses with tranquil or neutral expressions, corpses with conceited expressions, corpses with enigmatic expressions, corpses with beseeching expressions; all of the expressions of the corpses shared the aspect of being infantile and bemused.
Death has taken them all.  The bodies of the objects of sensuous desire are of the same nature.  My body is of the same nature and will end up the same way; there is no way that I can avoid that state.
Towards nightfall the pyres were lit.  Fong Tak’s eyes deepened into two crescent moons, observing the flesh blacken and peel away, the viscera and fluids escape and sizzle on the rosy coals, observing the color, consistency, and viscosity of each.  Fong Tak discerned that the nature of all seven of the viscera was the nature of decay, disintegration, passing away, and transience.
Thus is the emergence and the passing away of the marrow, thus is the passing away and decomposition of the phlegm, thus is the passing away and decomposition of the pus, thus is the passing away and decomposition of the sputum, thus is the passing away and decomposition of the blood, thus is the passing away and decomposition of the sweat, bile, grease, fat and tears; thus is the passing away and decomposition of the synovial fluid, the  passing away and decomposition of the saliva, the  passing away and decomposition of the mucus, and the passing away and decomposition of the urine and fecal matter.
At dawn on the following day Fong Tak’s nose distinguished a pungent stench that stood out from the general odor of putrefaction.  Out of the corner of his eye he distinguished a ragged shape at the edge of the grounds: the corpse of a woman had been abandoned there, denied proper rites.  Wild dogs were tearing at her face and legs.  The Abbot had ordered Fong Tak not to rise from his meditation until the seventh day, after the fashion of Shakyamuni.
Thus is the nature of the passing away and decomposition of the hair on the head, the nature of the passing away and decomposition of the hair on the body, the nature of the passing away and decomposition of the nails, the nature of the passing away and decomposition of the teeth, the nature of the passing away and decomposition of the skin, the nature of the passing away and decomposition of the flesh….
Towards nightfall—songs and chanting, the attendants lighting the pyres.  Fong Tak rose and took a burning faggot from the pyre.  He walked in the direction of the terrible stench.  The corpse was not where he had seen it earlier in the day.  The dogs had dragged it somewhere else.  The stench became more and more acute.  Inhaling the noxious fumes he swooned and fainted, and there he spent the rest of the night.
When he came to it was dawn and he discovered that he was staring into the eyes of the corpse—one eye a rosy, copper color, the other still the hazel color it had been in life.  The silk qin pao, embroidered with plum and cherry blossoms, was soaked through with the banquet of putrefaction that lay beneath, the maggots spilling out of the sleeves and collar, trickling down the crease of the pelvis—the lower garments had been torn from the woman’s body—she had been ravished before death—a trickle of maggots in the crease of the pelvis, like hems of white lace.  Dawn had broken.  In the gray half-light Fong Tak sat in perfect samadhi, observing the flesh of the parted thighs—the consistency of melting snow, translucent and gelatinous, smeared with a green slime that oozed from the pores.  The vagina sputtered and frothed, presently, like a senile mouth—a tongue of centipede emerging from between the labia and disappearing again.
The pyres still smoldered.  Fong Tak took some coals in his hands and struck a small fire to stave off the scavaging dogs.  As the sun rose up into the sky, Fong Tak discerned deep hues of sapphire, vermillion, fuscia, violet, pearly mauve, saffron, and lavender rising to the surface of the corpse’s flesh.  The colors swirled and mixed on her flesh like paints on an artist’s palette, or like the colors of dawn that filled the sky.
Reach out your hand, Fong Tak, and scatter the colors…
Fong Tak began to understand that he knew, that he recognized the face of one copper color and one hazel color.  It was a face he had not seen in fourteen years, not since his ordination at Shaolin



Now, here there is really nothing worthy of Ma Fang’s brushstroke, perfectly in line as it is with the five aesthetic laws.  Fong Tak laid the poor lads low in ones and twos, forming diamond fists and crane wing strikes.  Have you ever seen a stone blossom like a flower?  Kwaz!  The claws of the black tiger grasp the face!  The priest, however, did have one trick up his sleeve: he drew some lime from his pouch and blew it into Fong Tak’s eyes!  But Fong Tak is one to go down into hell and ward off divine protectors of combat arms.  He struck out at their celestial tract as well as the best of his ancestors.  If there were coffins to smash, he smashed them through and through.
At that moment Abbot Chi Thien Su was giving the sermon on the Thirty-sixth Case of the Gateless Gate in the Diamond of Resonance Courtyard of the Shaolin Monastery.  Wherefore we would do better to listen in:
“Master Goso invites us to consider,” (the Abbot was saying), “‘if you meet a man of Tao along the way, you must greet him with neither words nor silence.’  Therefore words are wrong.  But to remain silent is also wrong.  Therefore, how do you greet a man of Tao along the way?  It is really too simple for me to explain: greet him neither with words nor silence.  Wumengan offers this advice in the form of a gatha:

“‘If you meet a man of Tao along the way,
Greet him neither with words or silence.
I’ll give him with my fist the hardest blow I can—
Get it at once, get it immediately!’

“Therefore by using words you will not achieve it.  But then you think, ‘if words are wrong, then I will go to the other extreme and use silence.’  But that is also ineffective.  What do you do, then?  Most people would answer, ‘Words are full of deception, conceit, and malice, whereas silence is noble; I will use silence instead.’  But silence is also full of conceit and malice, and words are also noble.  Therefore, both words and silence are unacceptable.  Meanwhile, the man of Tao is waiting to hear from you.  What, then, can you offer him by way of greeting?”
One of the monks cried out, “I will strike him a blow of my fist, like Wumengan!”
“Fool!” responded the Abbot, “Think of your own answer, you lazy baldhead!”
The Abbot paced in front of the monks, allowing several moments of silence to pass.  No one dared speak up again.
“Wrong again!  Silence is also wrong!” cried out the Abbot, “Words are wrong, and silence is wrong!  The task ahead is immeasurable, impossible to accomplish, and utterly beyond imagination!  How do you dare even try?  You will not be able to say it with words, and you will not be able to say it with silence.  No philosopher can grasp it.  The shapes and forms of rhe greeting you must give are incalculable, with inconceivably many names that change when viewed from different angles.  You lazy baldheads who may form such thoughts as ‘the Way is difficult,’ ‘the Way is very difficult,’ ‘the Way is impossibly difficult,’ are like the lazy travelers in the Buddha’s parable!—Taken in by the illusory palaces, gardens, and streamlets.  The thought ‘the Way is not difficult’ is one garden; the thought ‘the Way is difficult’ is another; ‘the Way is extremely difficult’—that is a cool streamlet flowing through a quiet grove; further on you find a palace called ‘the Way is both difficult and easy,’ and are taken in by its charms; after countless lifetimes you emerge from the palace and find a lofty tower called ‘the Way is impossible,’ and waste more precious time there.  Further on there is a pleasant grove with cool breezes blowing called ‘It is neither both difficult and easy, nor neither difficult nor easy,’ you stop there and, before you know it, a minor kalpa has passed you by; further on you encounter another garden with a quaint brook and intriguing flowers of distinct colors called ‘It is both neither difficult nor easy, and both difficult and easy.’  Do not stay there!  Your cleverness is perverse, your thoughts are the charms of a sorceress whose only intent is to distract and detain you!  You will find no correct thought where the difficulty of the Way is concerned.  Move on and do not stay at the halfway point.”








87. The Commission places special gravity on particular acts carried out by State Agencies, especially the Army, in their operations against civilian communities.  The counterinsurgency strategy gave place not only to a basic violation of human rights, but also to a range of cruel methods, typically along the lines of the massacre, through which said violations were realized.  In the majority of the massacres, multiple acts of ferocity would precede, accompany, or follow the death of the victims.  Acts such as the killing of defenseless children, often by beating them against walls or throwing them alive into pits where the corpses of adults were later thrown; the amputation of limbs; the impaling of victims; the killing of persons by covering them in petrol and burning them alive; the extraction, in the presence of others, of the viscera of victims who were still alive; the confinement of people who had been mortally tortured, kept in agony for days; the opening of the wombs of pregnant women, and other equally atrocious actions, constituted acts both of extreme physical and psychological cruelty over the victim.

  THUS HAVE I HEARD.  The Buddhas, bodhisattva-mahasattvas, and their retinues of enlightened beings, tathagatas, bhikshus, once-returners, twice-returners, stream-enterers, sravakas, practitioners of the Way, and other disciples, numerous as atoms in ten thousand Buddha fields of chiliocosms of world systems, were assembled in the Flower Bank World composing the Maitreya Sutra of the Sublime Law of the Future Age.  All of the bodhisattva-mahasattvas present in the assemblage had cultivated roots of goodness for countless eons, were born from roots of pure goodness, and had fulfilled various means of space-time transcendence; their wisdom eye was clear; their eloquence was clear and oceanic; their intelligence held every niche of reality in a contemplative focus, and was of an inexhaustible, dignified, and honorable character; their insight was thoroughly refined and incisive.  They could manifest countless bodies in countless physical lands, participating in worldly activities without stepping down from their celestial dwelling places, which were outside of time.  They were constantly present at every place in the cosmos; their omniscience was non-discriminatory, and with concentration they could enter any single stage of realization or mind-state and yet also maintain the virtues of all stages.  They entered all the doors of universal oceans of meditative states in a single instant.  Always, by means of the vows of universal goodness and wisdom, they caused the wisdom body of all sentient beings to be fulfilled.  They sat in a state of perfect, unshakable meditation, and although their definitive dwelling places could not be identified, their bodies were constantly going to wherever there were sentient beings adrift on the sea of ignorance, sorrow, remorse, self-conceit, and perverse cleverness.  Wherever they saw sentient beings in pain and trouble, they manifested the body of a god, demi-god, kinnara king, titan king, garuda king, mahoraga king, yaksha king, naga king, kumbanda king, gandharva king, king of the thirty-three heavens, king of the Suyama heavens, king of the Tushita heavens, king of the Brahma heavens, a mountain spirit, a water spirit, a forest spirit, a fox spirit, a crop spirit, a fire spirit, an air spirit, a light spirit, an asura, a human, plant, animal, hungry ghost, or demon, as necessary to save those beings; wherever they saw sentient beings plunged in pain and sorrow, they manifested a hundred such bodies, a thousand such bodies, a hundred thousand such bodies, a million such bodies, a billion such bodies, a million billion such bodies, a trillion such bodies, a billion trillion such bodies, or as many bodies with as many enlightening faculties as were necessary to accomplish the task.  Wherever they saw sentient beings immersed in pain and sorrow, led about by ignorance and wrong views, they entered those lands with equanimity and were present there, not begrudging their eyes, ears, teeth, nose, nor the skin of their bodies, if that was what was required to save them, and yet dwelling at all times in perfect liberation.  As a result of their fulfillments they had attained degrees of incomparable purity called Unvariegated All-Pervading Resonance, Unshifting Networks of Interweaving Lights, Jeweled Arrays of All Colors, and so forth—the degrees of incomparable purity they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; degrees of contemplative focus called Universal Light of Great Power, Unsurpassed Focus, Incomparable True Strength, and so forth—the degrees of contemplative focus they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; degrees of pure knowledge called Undefiled Light, Pure Radiance, Unvariegated Resilience Everywhere, and so forth—the degrees of pure knowledge they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; spheres of expanding action called Pure Vision with Boundless Light Entering All Worlds, Unencumbered Subjective Projection Going All the Way, Incisive Insight Ending Disperse Atmospheres of Thought, and so forth—the spheres of expanding action they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; spheres of transcendence called Showing Delightful Adornments in All Worlds, Pure Adornments of the Essential Nature of the Cosmos of Realities, Pleasant Arrays of Auspicious Signs, and so forth—the spheres of transcendence they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; spheres of purposeful activity called Banner of Light of Clouds of Pure Virtue, Inconspicuous Adornments Uniting Everything, Majestic Arrays of Interweaving Light, and so forth—the spheres of purposeful activity they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; spheres of constant realization called Vast Light of the Ocean of All Verities, Present in All Reflections, Jeweled Canopy of Infinite Attainment, and so forth—the spheres of constant realization they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; oceans of knowledge of high intensities called Extremely Refined Effortless Vision, Adorned Networks of Resonance, Elucidating Resonance of Adorned Networks, and so forth—the oceans of knowledge of high intensities they had attained were as numerous as the atoms in ten billion chiliocosms; and so forth.  The world systems in ten billion trillion kotis of nayuta of chiliocosms might be ground up into atoms, and the atoms counted and their number known, but the attainments and virtues of the bodhisattva-mahasattvas were incalculable.  Even if Indra, king of the gods, were to begin counting and elucidating each one from his throne on Mount Sumeru, employing esoteric, super-symmetrical calculation techniques; even at the end of ten billion trillion myriads of kotis of nayuta asamkhyeya eons of such calculation, Indra would have tallied only the smallest fraction of the total number of the bodhisattva-mahasattva’s attainments and virtues.
Thus were the bodhisattva-mahasattvas assembled, composing the Maitreya Sutra of the Sublime Law of the Future Age.  They had just completed a chapter, and the next chapter had not yet begun.  One chapter of the Sutra was finished, and the other had not yet arisen.
	The bodhisattva-mahasattva Smantabhadra, seeing that one chapter of the Maitreya Sutra of the Sublime Law of the Future Age had been completed, and that the next chapter had not yet been started, thereupon arose from his lion throne, looked over the assemblage, and said in verse:

	One chapter of the Maitreya Sutra
Of the Sublime Law of the Future Age
Has just been completed,
	And the other has not yet begun.

	The bodhisattva-mahasattva Avalokiteshvara then stood up from her lotus throne and made a sign, indicating that she would speak.  The Buddhas who were present, seeing that she had made this sign, infused her with ten kinds of enhanced invincibility, ten kinds of unfailing presence of mind, ten kinds of pure knowledge of differentiation, ten kinds of unhindered recollection, ten kinds of enhanced skill of intellect, ten kinds of enhanced incision of insight, ten kinds of invincible power, ten kinds of unfailing understanding of all situations, ten kinds of attainment of discernment and teaching by the discursive knowledge of the omniscient, ten kinds of arrays of physical, verbal, and mental adornments, ten kinds of indomitable expertise of elocution, ten kinds of penetration of the nature of reality, and ten kinds of clear faith.
	The bodhisattva-mahasattva Avalokiteshvara, thus infused with these abilities, then looked over the assemblage and said:
“Ten thousand thousand myriad kotis of fragrant oceans of world systems to the left of where we are now assembled, there is a world called Variously Named, or Saha World, or Earth, with cities that have names like Shanghai, Peking, Los Angeles, Varanasi, Leningrad, and so forth; rivers that have names like Yangze, Ganges, Amazon, Volga, Potomac, and so forth.   The Saha World is partly pure and partly impure, partly made of matter and partly made of energy.  Seven of its ten spatial dimensions are collapsed, and its Buddha is called Shakyamuni.  A monk there has just attained an astounding insight.  It would be a suitable topic for the next chapter of the Maitreya Sutra of the Sublime Law of the Future Age.”
	The bodhisattva-mahasattva Smantabhadra, when he had heard the words spoken by Avalokiteshvara, then said, “What is the name of this monk, and what is his attainment?”
	“His name is Fong Tak.  His attainment is…”
	Before Avalokiteshvara could finish speaking, the entire Flower Bank World of chiliocosms of world systems as well as untold billions of myriads of kotis of nayuta chiliocosms of fragrant oceans of world systems in each of the ten directions then quaked in the six ways—that is, surging up in the east, sinking in the west, surging up in the west, sinking in the east, surging up in the south, sinking in the north, surging up in the north, sinking in the south, surging up on the periphery, sinking in the middle, surging up in the middle, and sinking on the periphery.
The bodhisattva-mahasattva Smantabhadra said:
	“What is the meaning of this quaking in the six ways?”
	“It is the result of the monk’s attainment,” replied Avalokiteshvara.
	The assemblage of bodhisattva-mahasattvas and enlightening beings then said as with one voice:
	“Excellent!  Excellent!  Summon this monk before us!”
	Fong Tak was then brought from the Saha World and made to appear before the assemblage, whereupon all of the bodhisattva-mahasattvas addressed him in unison, saying:
“What is your name, monk?”
“Fong Tak.”
	“Where do you come from, Fong Tak?”
	The monk Fong Tak then said:
	“The name of my world is Earth and has cities with names like Shanghai, Peking, Los Angeles, Varanasi, Leningrad, and so forth; its rivers have names like Yangze, Ganges, Amazon, Volga, Potomac, and so forth; it is partly pure and partly impure; seven of its ten spatial dimensions are collapsed, and its Buddha is Shakyamuni.”
	“What is the insight you attained, monk?”
	“There is no insight and no attainment,” replied the monk Fong Tak.
	“Do not try to hide your attainment from us, monk; we have seen it with our Buddha eye.”
	The monk Fong Tak, seeing that he could not hide his attainment from the Buddha eye of the assembled bodhisattvas, then said:
	“In some worlds it is called ‘air,’ in other worlds it is called ‘nothing-at-all’ or ‘unquestioned essence,’ in still other worlds it is referred to as ‘all pervading,’ ‘plainly obvious,’ or ‘always present everywhere,’ and in still others it has names like ‘always intoning ordinary essence in all shapes and forms.’  In my world it is called ‘love,’ and set apart from the other things as something special.  It has the habit of destroying everything.  Even advanced tathagatas, bhikshus, and once-returners are susceptible to its trinkets, swept up in its thrall, and cast down into various hells.  I have penetrated it completely.”
He then pulled a fan from his robe, bowed deeply, and opened the fan at the level of his forehead, holding it up for all to see.
Thereupon was painted an autumn portrait of incomparable detail and likeness, depicting mountains, rivers, clouds, streamlets, brooks, forests, lakes, fields, banks of mist, meadows, sunlight, country roads, temples, villages, forest paths, distant things and nearby things, things in the middle distance, things seen distantly at first and then seen from close by, things that were seen at first from too close or too far away and then later seen from a suitable distance; there were things portrayed in an isolated, incidental manner, elements that were swept up by an aesthetic principle into a uniform, coherent whole, details that seemed incidental at first but then swept up into a single coherent flow; there were also depicted independent, isolated instances of things such as autumn leaves changing color, or the tapered eaves of pagodas and monastery roofs, or forest paths, that were of a passing, incidental significance, but then swept up into a single coherent flow.
Indeed, so exquisite was the likeness unto reality that invisible things were depicted such as wind, sounds, dreams, moods, silences, angles of sunlight at different times of day, and the passage of time.  Leaves flickered in the breeze and fell from their branches, the snow fell, and the light changed.
At first you saw only the broad strokes of the portrait outlining the general elements: a forest here, mountains there, rivers, lakes, clouds, then details began to emerge: cedar forests, maple forests, lines of willow trees, forests of different species such as sassafras, plum trees, maples, willows, persimmon trees, cedars, and so on; there were autumn blossoms sailing to the ground, plum blossoms, orange blossoms, and so forth; there were also clouds of different kinds: towering clouds, feathery clouds, clouds of distinct shapes, clouds of indistinct shapes; there were different kinds of mountains and topography: sloping green mountains, sharp rocky mountains, mountains capped by ice and snow; there were different kinds of rivers and tributaries: broad rivers containing sandbars, jetties, and islets, rivers that cut through plains, shifting course in the rainy season, plus small streamlets, forest brooks winding through the leafy detritus and mossy rocks; there was sunlight falling through the autumn canopy at different angles, patches of sunlight on the forest floor taking different shapes through the clouds and autumn foliage; you saw that the leaves were falling and that the forest brooks sparkled in the mottled halflight of the forest floor
Indeed, so exquisite, so incomparable was the likeness of the portrait that invisible things were depicted such as the moods, dreams, attitudes, and peripeteia of individuals, plus the moods, attitudes, and peripeteia of entire populations, plus the moods, attitudes, and peripeteia of epochs, and so forth: there were moods that were nebulous and ill-defined, moods that were well-defined, moods that were ill-defined but became gradually clearer, moods that were ill-defined and remained that way, moods that were subtle, moods that were obvious, moods that were imperceptible, moods that were changing, moods that were changing in an obvious way, moods that were changing in a subtle way, moods that were changing in an imperceptible way, moods that were predictable, moods that were unforeseen.
At first you saw the contents of the portrait in broad outline and in isolation from each other, but then the relation between the different things gradually became apparent, and the details that seemed incidental at first began to sweep together into a uniform, coherent whole.
For example, at first you saw autumn foliage and a whispering breeze in isolation from each other, then you saw autumn foliage stirred by the whispering breeze; first you saw sunlight and autumn canopies of leaves as separate, then you saw mottled halflight falling across the leafy autumn detritus; first you saw a streamlet or brook, moss-covered rocks and leafy detritus, sunlight, in isolation from each other, then you saw a streamlet or brook winding down through the mossy rocks and leafy detritus twinkling in the mottled half-light that filters through the autumn canopy; you saw a twinkling brook, then a forest, then sunlight; you saw mountain slopes, then valleys, valleys, then valleys filled with autumn colors, then valleys, filled with autumn colors, draped across the mountain slopes like curtains of various autumn colors; first you saw mountains, for example, then banks of mist, then mountains shrouded in banks of mist; sunlight, then autumn sunlight, autumn sunlight, then autumn sunlight at sunset, autumn sunlight at sunset, clouds, then thin slats of clouds over the horizon, then poignant vermillion colors of clouds over the horizon at sunset, plus a crop of wheat ripe for the harvest, plus wind; wind, then waves of wind; waves of wind, then autumn waves of wind; autumn waves of wind, then a crop of wheat ripe for the harvest bending under the autumn waves of wind.  Then autumn sunlight, then poignant vermillion slats of clouds over the flowing waves of autumn wheat.
Black hair, face the color of autumn persimmons, then black hair scattered over the western half of the face.  Then horizontal slats of autumn sunlight; horizontal slats of autumn sunlight, then horizontal slats of autumn sunlight striking the western half of the face; horizontal slats of autumn sunlight striking the western half of the face, then black hair; black hair, then curtains of black hair drawn across the western half of the face, shading the eyes from the horizontal slats of autumn sunlight that slip through the poignant vermillion colors of autumn clouds at sunset.  Eyes, then hazel eyes; hazel eyes, then rainwater.
The relation between some details wasn’t clear just yet, and your eye moved to another group of aesthetic details, tried out a different combination, for the details that belonged to and constituted one aesthetic element also belonged to and constituted the other elements, which by their permutative aspect were countless thousands of billions in number, and the combinatoria of permutations of details of aesthetic elements was infinite.
Eyes, then hazel eyes; hazel eyes, then autumn sunlight; poignant curtains of black hair turning gold and sapphire in the autumn light; then a splinter of amber light that slips through the golden black tassels of hair and collects in a little pool on the hazel iris of the eye, like rainwater that collects on the lip of a cairn.
The relation between certain details wasn’t clear just yet, and your eye moved to another group of aesthetic details, tried out a different combination, like the shuttle that looks for a way to weave the different threads of the distaff into a pleasing pattern, for the details that belonged to and constituted one aesthetic element also belonged to and constituted the other elements, which by their permutative aspect were countless thousands of billions in number, and the combinatoria of permutations of details of aesthetic elements was infinite.
Mottled light on the forest floor; forest halflight beneath the autumn foliage, the forest brook twinkling in the forest halflight; sound, wind, whispering sound, whispering sound of wind; path, autumn leaves, the monastery, cairns, and pagodas, autumn leaves on the path that lead from the monastery to the Pagoda Forest; whispering sound of wind, autumn leaves on the path that lead to the monastery, the whispering sound of the wind blowing leaves along the autumn path that leads down to the Pagoda Forest.  Snow.  Snow falling through the air.  Snow covering the ground.  The Willow Tree Line.  Shanhaiguan Pass.  Not far from there, the Tungiyya Valley.
Even as the waves of the sea are always combining, changing shape, and multiplying, and by their aspect of combining, changing shape, and multiplying cannot be counted, even so were the different aesthetic details of the portrait always combining, changing shape, and multiplying, and by their aspect of combining, changing shape, and multiplying were impossible to behold, impossible to register, impossible to capture in theories, impossible to capture with clever discursive techniques.
The eye, in contemplating the brook twinkling in the mottled half-light beneath the autumn leaves knocked down by the wind, was in the same instant transported to the whispering sound of the wind on the autumn path leading up to the monastery; in the same instant of contemplating the whispering sound of the wind on the autumn path, was transported to the splinter of amber light slipping through the golden black tassels of curtains of hair; in transporting to the splinter of amber light slipping through the golden black tassels of curtains of hair, was also contemplating the beams of sunlight filtering through the autumn foliage and taking different shapes on the forest floor; in contemplating the beams of sunlight filtering through the autumn foliage and taking different shapes on the forest floor, was transported to the pool of rainwater that collects on the lip of a cairn in the Pagoda Forest, like a pool of light collecting on the hazel iris of an eye; in transporting to the rainwater that collects on the lip of a cairn in the Pagoda Forest like a pool of light collecting on the hazel iris of an eye, was also contemplating the autumn leaves that fell onto the mossy forest brook, mottled all over with patches of sunlight; in contemplating the autumn leaves that fell onto the mossy forest brook mottled all over with patches of sunlight, was transported to the patches of autumn sunlight that fell onto the mossy forest brook, mottled all over with autumn leaves; in transporting to the patches of autumn sunlight that fell onto the mossy forest brook mottled all over with autumn leaves, was also contemplating the autumn leaves on the forest path leading down to the Pagoda Forest; in contemplating the autumn leaves on the forest path leading down to the Pagoda Forest, was transported to the twinkling patches of mottled sunlight, mottled all over with fallen autumn leaves, on the brook; and so forth.
And the pangs of vertigo saddened the eye, seeing that it would not be possible to behold the portrait, to make clever observations about the portrait, to capture the meaning of the portrait in theories, and so forth, without becoming a part of it; seeing that from the outside it was possible to ascertain the nature of the parchment on which the portrait was painted, discerning whether it was made of rice fibers or some other fiber, where the fibers where grown, the name of the farmer who grew them, whether the farmer was happy or sad, whether the rain that year was sufficient or lacking, ascertaining the nature of the pigments used in the portrait, discerning that the mauve color is made from zinc extracted from such and such a river, that the blue color is made from lapis lazuli obtained from Persian merchants in exchange for silk, that the red color is made from oxidized ores found in such and such a river, that the yellow color is made from cadmium sulfides extracted from such and such a mountain, and so forth, but that after ascertaining all of these things it would still not be possible to behold the portrait, to make clever observations about the portrait, to capture the meaning of the portrait in theories, and so forth, without becoming a part of it.  And the pangs of vertigo saddened the eye, seeing that it would not be possible to hold on to its honed ideas about reality and artifice.
Even the bodhisattva-mahasattvas who were in the assembly, to maintain concentration, were compelled to recite the following gatha:

This autumn portrait is just a painting
And is not real.
There are mountains, rivers, clouds,
Depicted, but none of it is real.
In fact there is only ink, pigment, and paper.

	Indeed, so exquisite was the likeness of the autumn portrait that even were you to withdraw into profound atmospheres of concentration and form the insight that this is just a painting; nothing portrayed therein is real.  I will digest the meaning of this portrait, appreciate its beauty, decipher its signs, and make appropriate connections among its different elements while always maintaining the distinction between reality and painting—so exquisite, so unparalleled was the likeness of the autumn portrait that even this insight would be captured and portrayed therein.

I will digest the meaning of this portrait
Always maintaining the distinction
Between reality and painting,
Knowing that the distinction
Between reality and painting
Is not real.

Indeed, so exquisite, so incomparable was the likeness of the autumn portrait that even were you to withdraw into profound atmospheres of concentration and form the insight that this is just a painting; although there are streamlets, rivers, lakes, coniferous and deciduous forests, mountains, open fields, monasteries, stirring leaves, compelling dramatic situations, clouds, banks of mist, autumn sunlight, mountains shrouded in banks of mist, leaves turning different shades of mauve, amber, sapphire, and hazel colors, stirred by the breeze, country roads, depicted in the painting, and even though these things are depicted with such likeness that even were one to withdraw into profound atmospheres of concentration, maintain perspective and form the insight that ‘this is just a painting; nothing portrayed therein is real.  There are streamlets, rivers, lakes, coniferous and deciduous forests, mountains, open fields, monasteries, stirring leaves, compelling dramatic situations, clouds, banks of mist, autumn sunlight, mountains shrouded in banks of mist, leaves turning different shades of mauve, amber, sapphire, and hazel colors, stirred by the breeze, country roads, and so on, depicted in this painting, but none of these things are actually there; and in fact there is just ink and paper’—so exquisite, indeed, so unparalleled is the likeness of the autumn portrait that it would capture even this equanamous observation and encompass it as another one of the objects portrayed therein—so exquisite, indeed, so incomparable, was the likeness of the painting unto reality that even this insight would be captured and encompassed in the autumn portrait as another one of the objects portrayed therein.
There on the snowy plain of the Tungiyya Valley, a girl, dressed in an embroidered qin pao, contemplating the broken slats of ice.  A forest pool, frozen over with ice at first, then broken through by the hooves of charging cavalry.  Then a girl, standing at the edge of the forest pool, contemplating the broken slats of ice.
The eye moved to another detail, another aesthetic element, tried out a different combination, like a shuttle looking for a way to weave the different threads of the distaff into a pleasing pattern.  The forms of individual figures of characters began to appear, imperceptible at first, then appearing.  Individual figures of characters that did not stand out at first, just as no particular grain of sand stands out on the banks of the Ganges, then standing out.
There, a path with autumn leaves, leading down from Shaolin Monastery; cairns and pagodas on the mountainside; Mount Song, a path covered with autumn leaves, leading down to the Pagoda Forest, not far from Shaolin Monastery, on Mount Song.




“Reality and fiction, good and evil, time and space, before and after, subject and object—these are the names of the various flames that consume the universe.  In fact there are no names or forms to anything, no edges by which to grab hold of, and no flames consuming the universe; but human beings, immersed in ignorance, invent these names, and frame the picture in these edges, consume the universe with these flames,”
