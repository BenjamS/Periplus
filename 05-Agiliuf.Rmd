Etude: Agiliuf

Aigiluf was one of the boys who were condemned to burn in Hell for eternity, and within the gates of Dis, which was Beelzebub’s stronghold, he shoveled the fiery stacks of faetor that would accumulate in the fourth malbowge of the Eighth Circle.  And it was his category of Punishment that the fiery stacks of manure would accumulate into tall, nitric columns that would topple and fall on top of him and the fellow damned in his category, burying and consuming them all together, again and again.
	Most of the other fellow damned around Agluf were much older than him.  It was rare indeed to find a child of less than twelve years of age in Hell, but it did happen.  They were treated no better than the rest, were expected to shoulder an equal share of the workload, and the demon taskmasters skewered and lacerated them with equal mercilessness.
For how many ages it had gone on like this Algiuf did not know.  And for all eternity it was yet to go on.
	“Hey-ho!  Quitting time!”
	At “quitting time” each day when the demon taskmasters would play that dirty and evil trick of blowing a whistle and calling out “quitting time!”  When the demons were rolling on the ground with laughter, and his fellow souls moaning with renewed remorse, Agluf would not get the joke and slipped away innocently and unnoticed.  He would take walks then among the tortures of the other damned in other circles.  Not taking much interest in the various methods of torture, which were not, in truth, terribly inventive from one case to the other, he marveled rather at the cavernous expanses of darkness which stretched, so it seemed, infinitely above his blistering feet.  A fresh conflagration of souls would erupt from the molten lakes, and the little leaf storm of lost souls—whole swirling shoals of lost souls!—would swirl through the vault and dash itself against the empty fumes.
One of his favorite places to stroll was the banks of the Styx, which are guarded by centaurs.  The centaurs, so it seemed to him, were the most intriguing beasts of Hell.  Trotting up and down the banks, they did not carry weapons or instruments of torture (apart from their crossbows, which always remained slung over their backs and were never used), and did not attack the damned who were boiling in the river, but merely corralled them whenever they tried to climb out.
“Shoo!  Shoo, there!  Back you go!” they would call out good-naturedly, twirling their hoofs in the air.  They allowed Aigluf to approach them, and often he got quite close to them, but they ignored him pompously.  Once, Agulf saw, when a demon suddenly burst forth onto the bank and, with murderous zeal, began flaying the skin of the damned who were under the centaurs’ charge; the centaurs circled round him and confiscated his tenterhooks.  Aigiliuf could not hear the words exchanged, but he saw a lot of finger waving, and, finally, the centaurs punctuated their reprimand with a brisk slap on the demon’s face.  The demon let out a genuine howl of shame and ran back into the dense undergrowth with his spade-tail between his legs.
From every socket and crevice along the way of these walks, meanwhile, tormented souls emerged like little spiders from their hidden nests.  Taking him for a mortal, a traveler from above, they would ask him of news from Florence and Khanbaliq, and of the other places that had been their homes in the life before.  But he was not mortal of course, and he told them: “But I am not mortal!  I live here like you!”
	“Fie!” they would call out, “and how is it you just prance about as you please?”
	“I just do!  I swear!”
	“Fie!  He means to mock us, he does!  Well, you’ll get yours, you just wait, little boy!”
	“But I swear!  I am damned just like you, and I live here.”
	“And then how is it you just come and go as you please?  Ha!  He must think we’re imbeciles.  Well, there’ll be the Devil to pay for your insolence!”
	“But, I swear—”
But Aguilif could not get a word in edgewise at this point; and he moved on, marveling at the implacable disbelief of the damned.
	The terminus of these strolls was invariably the circle of giants, the circle before the last, where the giant Nimrod lived.  Agulif (the vapors of Hell always distorted the spelling of his name) would approach from the edge of the pit above so that he was more or less eye-level with Nimrod.  Their exchanges were always enjoyable and Nimrod appreciated the fact that Agiliuf could understand him when he spoke.  Through his conversations with Nimrod, Aigilf had learned that Nimrod had been condemned to Hell for multiplying the languages of the earth, which was said to have spread confusion.  His punishment in Hell was that he should never again be understood by anyone, but somehow Ailiuf could understand him.
	“That’s because when there’s a problem understanding,” said Agiluf, “it’s because you’re not listening in the right way that you have to.”
	“Brahr breahr bah-bee boo!”
	“Yeah.”
No one else, Nimrod once confided to Aiglif, had ever been able to understand him when he spoke.  That was his punishment.  And he had to wear a great big horn around his neck, which was intended as a symbol of shame and as a mockery of his inarticulate solitude, but which, during the course of eternity, he had slowly begun to revaluate as a means of expression.
“And that big horn tied around your neck?  What’s that for?”
“Breeeh brahr breeboo.  Brarh brahr bree-bree-breeauah!”
“Oh?  What kind of special occasions?”
At this point in the conversation, demons who had overheard them would approach the edge of the circle and begin jeering at Nimrod:
“Blah, blah, blee, blee!  Look at me I’m Nimrod I can’t talk right!  Ha, ha!” for example, they would say in a mocking tone, or, “Look at me I’m Nimrod I’m a big dummy and I talk funny ha!”  They would also cast their long tenterhooks at him as they shouted these taunts, but the hooks would merely tinkle off his chest like little pebbles thrown against a cliff face; and this, naturally, infuriated the demons still more, and they would hurl more verbal abuse at him:
“Can’t talk right, can’t talk right!  Blow your horn!”
“Blow your horn!”
“Why don’t you just blow your horn stupid, if you can’t talk right dummy!”
“Dummy-stupid blow your horn!”
And Nimrod’s giant fingers would begin to fondle his horn nervously.
It was clear from Agiliuf’s conversations with Nimrod that Nimrod did not like to blow his horn for just any odd reason, but that his horn, over the course of eternity, had become for him a means of expressing the stirrings deep within his chest, which had gone unexpressed for all eternity.  Even though the horn was meant as a mockery and an eternal reminder of his inability to communicate, it had begun to take on this significance for him in recent aeons.  Nimrod was still shy about it, and reserved his horn blowing for only the most “special occasions,” but the revaluated significance was growing stronger.  And here the demons were forcing him to blow his horn out of mere spite!  Bastards!
“Dummy stupid dummy stupid!”
“Blah!  Look at me I’m Nimrod and I can’t talk right!”
“Blah blah!  Look at me I’m stupid!”
Well!  Even the stoutest soul could only take so much of this relentless abuse, and Nimrod’s fingers began to fondle the horn around his neck, and then at last his hands clasped the horn and he blew a long, lugubrious note:

Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhoooooooooooooooo!
	
which echoed in every corner of Hell.


When Agiluf returned from these sallies and told his fellows what he had seen, they would berate him.  “Look,” they would tell him, as if in explanation, “this is Hell!”  But before they could finish, they would be skewered through by a demon’s pike and tossed up through the toxic fumes into another bowge.
“Shhhhhh, this is Hell!” another would cry out, “and there is no talking allowed!  You wanna get us all in trouble?”  (“No talking” was one of the rules of Hell, although in Hell it was impossible to know when rules would be enforced, and when, out of malicious deceit, a blind eye would be cast).  And then he, too, would be flayed and hooked through by the demons’ skewers, and lobbed into one of the other pits of darkness.
	Still another of Agluf’s fellow souls would step forward.  “Don’t you see, little boy?  This is Hell!  All that about going on strolls, impossible!”
	And then he would be crushed beneath a blazing stack of faetor which would fall over on top of him just then.
When his fellows were hooked through and lobbed into the air, Aluf peered into the darkness to see what monster had done it.  But this was another of the strange things about Hell: when he saw there in the darkness what monster or demon had skewered his fellow, well, what he saw there in the darkness were a bunch of sulfurous fumes, but no demons per se.  “Well,” he thought to himself, “there must surely be some monster back there in the darkness who skewered my good friend and lobbed him up into the fumy vault,” and he peered harder into the sulfurous darkness, looking for the demon or monster who had done it, or perhaps the minotaur had come down or the erinyes, or maybe one of the gorgons had done it—yes that was it! one of the gorgons had done it, surely!
But no, peering there into the sulfurous pitch, no, Aiguilif could not say that he had in fact seen a gorgon, although it had been a good guess.
Moreover, Ailuif had never actually seen one of the big monsters attack a soul.  Sometimes Agiliuf went up to the walls around the sixth circle (the walls of Dis) and ran through the legs of the minotaur who stood at the passage.  The minotaur would let out a howl and hurl himself on the ground, kicking and pounding the ground with his fists, which did not torment Agulf in the least, and was even rather amusing.  Agiliuf did not know it (he had died a very, very long time ago) but the monsters of Hell were feeling rather intimidated by recent developments in weapons technology on earth and were feeling insecure about themselves.


One day, Aigilf decided to go to Heaven.
He was strolling along as was his habit, without a care in the world, when lo! he saw a figure strolling towards him in the opposite direction.  He jumped aside and hid behind a rock, fearing it might be a monster.  But when the figure approached, it turned out to be an old man, bearded and quite gray.  Agluf sprung from his hiding place.
“Who are you, sir?” he asked.
“I am a Peripatetic,” he said, hoisting himself onto a broad, flat stone.
“Oh yes, from the first circle.”
“That’s correct, my boy.”
“Hey, do you ever notice anything…odd about this place?” asked Agluf.
“Like what?”
“I’ve noticed, for example, I saw, once…the centaurs, who live on the banks of the Styx, they....”
“Hm’mm,” said the Peripatetic, nodding his head.
“And do you notice, many times you don’t see the demons when they punish the souls…”
“Hm’mmm,” said the Peripatetic with a knowing glance.  Apparently he had already beheld such things, and perhaps had even contemplated them at length.
He stepped up onto a smooth obsidian perch and began to inspect its surface.
“What are you up to?” asked Ailif.
“In all the eternity of my damnation I have not yet come across a single smooth, flat stone in Hell.  They are all jagged and oxidized, you know.  But yesterday as I strolled by here I saw this broad, flat stone, devoid of sharp edges and corrugations….  Well!  I resolved then to descend on the morrow to set aside my staff and my ambles for a while, and to recline upon this rare stone in contemplation of this place, for one aeon.”
As he said this, the Peripatetic set down his staff and sat down in a curious cross-legged position.  He trained his eyes aloft, transfixing all the evil and darkness of Hell in his gaze; his pupils deepened; and then he shut his eyes.
“Oh,” responded Aigulf.
“What are you doing?” asked Ailiuf.
“Zazen,” said the Peripatetic without opening his eyes.
“Huh?”
“You see, my boy, we in the first circle were damned because of our pagan orientation; that is, we were punished for not having known God, even though it was not possible to know God since he did not yet exist.  Not a very fair deal by anyone’s standard, but we were pious and went along with it for centuries and millennia, until at last, not too long ago, we realized that God was cool.”
“When did you realize that God was cool?”
“About the time of the Lover Man Sessions—you know, Charlie Parker.”
“Charlie Parker?”
“Well, there were a lot of contributors; Miles Davis came out with the Birth of the Cool around the same time.  There was Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, and of course you had Benny Moré and Perez Prado down in Cuba.  Yeah man!  Dangerous!  Bee-skee-dat, doop, doop, shawoop…” The Peripatetic, carried away by his nostalgia, broke into a bit of scatting briefly.
“Oh.”
“And then when we saw that God was cool like that, we knew He wouldn’t keep us here in Hell for such a jive gig.  So we all put our heads together and got to thinking…”
“Oh,” said Aigiluf, “I want to go to Heaven.”
The Peripatetic opened his eyes.
“Heaven?” he murmured, bringing his hand to his beard.  And then, after remaining silent for a long time, he said, “What a good idea, my boy.  I might have joined you had I not just resolved to recline upon this rock for one aeon, contemplating Hell.”
Algiuf said goodbye to the Peripatetic and turned up the slope towards the Fifth Circle.
“Ahoy there, traveler!  What news from Florence?  Eh, it’s you again!  Fie on you!  Fie!  This is Hell, or did no one tell you?  No walking about in Hell!  Fie!”
	When he reached the Fifth Circle his companions we’re still shoveling the blazing faetor into tall shit stacks, even though it was now long after quitting time.  Aglf approached them and bade them adieu, but they were engrossed in their needless chore and paid no attention to him.
“So long friends,” he said to them, at last, climbing up onto the ridge of the malbowge and waving his hand, “So long!”
“So long?  Wha—?  Whadya mean ‘so long?’  Where do you think you’re going?”
“Heaven.”
“But, why, you just don’t seem to understand anything sonny!  This is Hell, see, with a capital ‘H!’”
“There’s no going to Heaven when you’re in Hell!  No taking pleasant strolls, no distracting conversations, well, you’ll get yours, sonny!  You’ll get yours!”
“Well, goodbye,” he said.
Algiuf’s infernal companions had never been particularly tender towards him, but they were his infernal companions all the same, and Aliuf could not help but shed a tear at their parting.


“Hey wait just a moment,” he heard from behind him as walked up past the fourth circle, “Where is it you’re going again?”
Turning around, he saw a group of curious souls.
“Heaven.”
“Ha!  And what?  Think you’ve suffered enough?  You have suffered quite a bit, it’s true!  Maybe you should be up for revision.  Although me, I’ve been here far longer!  How many burning shit-stacks have fallen on top of you?”
“I don’t know,” responded Aulifg, “I just want to go to Heaven.”
“But—wha—I can’t believe my ears!  ‘Just want to go to Heaven,’ he says, as if this were a country club.  Well!  How many burning shit-sticks have fallen on top of you, eh?  That’s what counts, sonny.  Why, if it weren’t for the fact I keep losing count, I’d surely have saved up enough points to go to Heaven by now, when the revision officer comes around.”
“Points?  What do you mean ‘points?’” said another soul, who caught up with them just then.
“Haven’t you heard about the new points program?”
“Fool!  That’s just another joke they play on us—like ‘quitting time’!”
“I know, I know!  But just imagine if it were true!  Oh if only it were true!  How scintillating!  How—Arrrrrggggggghhhhhhhh!—”
The soul, at this point, was skewered through with hooks and pikes and tossed high up into the darkness.
“You know,” said another soul who drew near, scratching his chin contemplatively, “if it’s Heaven you’re going to, you’ll have to ask the big boss first.”
“The big boss?”
“Beelzebub.”
“Ah!” cried another fellow, “He’s horrible!  He’s got huge fangs!”
“Fangs is nothing!  He’s go these big arms that reach out and pop you like a berry!  Oh yes, it’s nasty like that.”
“Ha!  Berries is nothing!  His body’s covered with spikes.  His eyes have teeth which shoot out at you!”
“Bah!  Spikes and teeth is nothing!  He has horns on his head, and…and big spikes that…that spit flames!  And his eyes have these big teeth that…shoot out at you and it’s just awful, I tell you!  Awful!”
“What?” said Aulgif.
“Shush boy!”
“Fie on you!”
“Fie!”
“Who, the Devil?” said another soul who approached the group, “yes, I’ve gone and seen him.”  It was Ferdinand, who was respected in some circles for the D.Phil. work he had done at All Souls College in Oxford, before hurling himself from the spires before exam night.  “Now, the Devil, you see, what he does is he uses some kind of telekinesis, oh yes!  And…and your skin erupts all over in hives…indeed….  Fools, well!  All of the evils you can think of would not approach the evil of the prince of darkness.  Why, but, it does not even occur to me…but how to explain it to you simpletons!  Do you think that the immeasurable pain of the Devil’s methods can be comprehended by mere mortals?  No!  It must be some kind of, hm’mm, yes, a kind of telekinesis that causes the skin to erupt in hives, for, hm’mmm, indeed, only in that way would God’s holy magnificence be reflected…”
The other souls gathered closer and tried to understand what Ferdinand was saying, since Ferdinand had done some D.Phil work at All Souls College in Oxford and was capable of abstract thought, but suddenly Ferdinand fell silent and brought his finger to his lips.  Of course!  They had forgotten about the “no talking” rule!  Ooooohh they were in big trouble now, and their faces elongated into spectral frowns, and their eyes darted up into the darkness in anticipation of the white-hot skewers, barbs, tenterhooks, pikes, boiling pitch, skewers, barbs, pikes, and white-hot tenterhooks that would now come pouring down on their heads from the cavernous darkness.  And their eyes darted about the vaulted pitch, watching for where the white-hot skewers, tenterhooks, pikes, boiling pitch, skewers, flying steak knives, pikes, bits of hot charcoal, tenterhooks, and boiling pitch would come flailing down on them now at any moment like a bat out of Hell.  Oh yes, they were in for it now!  A terrible mess, big trouble, yes sir!—What with the boiling pitch, fire spits, bits of hot charcoal and steak knives, the pikes and tenterhooks, poison darts, tenterhooks, barbs, and so on, poison blow darts, for example, well, it was curtains for them!  And they huddled together and peered into the vaulted darkness.
Any moment now the fire-spits, pikes, skewers, poison blow-darts, flying steak knives, tenterhooks, fire-spits, and skewers, pots full of hot boiling water, and so forth, would come pouring down upon their heads like nobody’s business.


Aigluf, for his part, had already turned and headed toward the nadir of Hell where the Devil, or Beelzebub or Satan, was known to reside.  He had not known that you had to get Beelzebub’s permission first.  But the rules were the rules, and if that was what he had to do, then that was what he had to do.
When he reached the edge of the pit he peered into the swirling void.  How would he get to the bottom?  Should he cast himself over the edge?  “As shades we do not have a body, after all, and so such things won’t hurt the way they once did,” he reasoned to himself.
But it was not necessary.  The thunder of the vortex crashed louder and louder in his ears and he discerned his good friend Nimrod sprinting through the noxious purple fumes, his footsteps resounding and resounding like thunder.  The disconsolate giant then drew himself up, raised his horn to his lips, and blew two droning notes such as Agluf had never yet heard him play, at which a reeking blast of wind arose from the pit below, tangling Aigilf’s hair; and the massive winged beast, called Antaeus, rose from the abyss in response to Nimrod’s call.  His beating wings stirred all the filth of Hell into a vortex of reeking winds that bore bits of faetor and rotten flesh, but Agulf had grown used to all that by now, and with a running start he leapt over the void onto the winged beast’s back, and was borne down through the swirling vortex.
	Antaeus bore Aigluf down to the nadir of Hell, where the frozen lake of Cocataeus stretches out in all directions, studded with the faces of the damned who are frozen in the lake up to their jowls (this being their punishment).  Ailif alighted from Antaeus and gazed across the frozen lake, careful not to step on the faces of the damned that poked out from the ice like mollusks on the shoals at low tide.  A gentle susurrus arose from the ice surface as the damned tried to ask for news from home through their frozen lips, tearing the skin of their jowls and hemorrhaging across the ice.  Indeed, it was the quietest place that Agiluf had yet visited in Hell.
Aigluf proceeded steadfastly, and after a very long walk the yellow mists became thicker and more forbidding, and the pleading voices of the frozen damned died away behind him; and Aigliuf sensed that he was approaching the Devil.
	He slowed his steps and looked carefully about him.  The words of his companions came back to him, filling him with foreboding: “The Devil?  Oooohh he’s awful!  Got big spikes all over’im.” 
	There!  Something ahead!  The putrid yellow mists were clearing.  But what did he see there?  Two figures?  Two!  There were two of them!  Two Devils!  Ah, it was much worse than anyone had ever imagined!
	But, no, no, now he saw that it was not two Devils.  What he saw was something still more peculiar: there at the very nadir of hell, in the place where the Devil should be, there were rather just two…people.
“And who are you?” asked Algiuf.
“We are Adam and Eve.”
“Oh.”
“It was our punishment to be chewed up in the Devil’s mouth for all eternity.  But now the Devil has gone and disappeared.”
“What?”
“The Devil has disappeared.”
“Well, where did he go, because I need to ask him something.”
“Couldn’t say for sure,” responded Adam, “It all started back around the time of Charlie Parker—”
“Yeah, about the time of the Lover Man Sessions—you know, Charlie Parker,” interjected Eve.
“Yes dear that’s right, so about that time—I think Miles Davis was working on a project too—”
“Yeah, Miles Davis was working on the ‘Birth of Cool,’ then later on you had Coltrane, Mingus, and so on.”
“Well, around that time, Eve and I noticed that the Devil’s chewing was getting somewhat…well, gummy.  I mean—right Eve?—I mean, I remember we were up there in the Devil’s maw getting all chewed up like that, and then I just remember looking over to you, honey, and I was like, ‘Eve honey, this is starting to get all gummy up here in Satan’s mouth.’”
“Yeah,” said Eve, “he had lost his teeth.”
“Yeah, that’s what I was getting to.  The Devil had lost his teeth.  And then not long after that, the Devil took us down from his mouth and said, ‘Look I don’t know what’s happening, I think it has something to do with Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, but anyway I’m starting to disappear.  And, well, before I disappear altogether, I just want to say a few things—’”
“Yes that’s right,” picked up Eve, “and then he said, ‘I’m leaving you guys in charge.  If anyone comes down here, you know, down here to the nadir of Hell, I want you to give them this message…”
“What was the message?” asked Ailiguf.
“The message was: ‘He started it.  It’s him that’s doing it, not me.’”
“Oh.”
“Not long after that, the rest of Satan disappeared.”
“Vanished,” said Eve.
“Yeah, disappeared.”
“Vanished,” said Eve.
“Oh,” said Agliuf.
The three shades were silent for a moment.  Then Algiuf said:
“Well, I’m going to Heaven now.  Want to come along?”
“Thanks, but the Devil left us in charge down here and so we should probably stay and look after things.  But thanks for the invite.”


Aliuf returned to the winged beast Antaeus, which bore him back up to the edge of the tenth malbowge of the eight circle.  Agulf waved goodbye to Nimrod and started upward on his walk to Heaven.  Nimrod took his horn and blew a long, triumphant note such as had never been heard in Hell, and the sound bore Alguf up through the reeking vapors; Agiluf’s hands and feet had left the rocks, and he was flying upward, upward, through the poisonous fogs.  And just before they disappeared beneath the poisonous fumes, Agiluf called down to his damned companions, inviting them to come along too; but again they responded in their usual manner, shaking their fists indignantly in the air, and saying, “You don’t seem to understand that this is Hell!  Capital ‘H,’ sonny!”
He flew over the Styx where the centaurs marveled at his flight and looked at him through telescopes, and all the monsters and gatekeepers—the Minotaur and the Erinyes, Minos and Charon—were vexed by his passage and scratched their chins.  They howled out in indignation, and the howls bore Aigilf higher and higher through the vapors of Hell, through the roofs of the caverns, through the open sky, and upward and upward to Heaven, as he had decided.
And what was Heaven like?  Well, that’s something that each of you will have to go and experience for yourself.  As for Agliuf, in the morning, when the tide went out, he left with his father to pull oysters from the shoals.  He did not wonder about the many forms of Heaven or speculate that each one perceived the Heaven that befits them.  He reached out and held the flax cloth between his hands, his hands reached out and grasped his mother’s spindles and distaff; his fingers traced the patterns of cloth.  Indeed, Agiluf could not distinguish it too much from life.  He knew that Heaven was different because it was longer than life, but if it was timelessness, and not time, that counted, then there was really no way to distinguish it from the way life had been.  And at this point Aigiliuf would forget what he had been trying to figure out and sprint off across the tidal flats, the two figures of mother and father in the distance.  And like this it went on for a long time—just how long Agiluf did not know—and was yet to go on forever more.
“The moral of the story,” said Agliuf to his father one day, “is that life is short, and eternity even shorter.”
