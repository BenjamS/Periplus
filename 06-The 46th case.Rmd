The 46th case


I. Revival at Midcourse

•	Tian An’s eyes, likewise, began to lose their hold on the rails of newsprint, drifting across the page, until they snagged upon one of those peculiar phrases that periodically confounded the precarious mastery of English he had achieved after some twenty-five years of Sysiphean effort, a phrase written with English characters but belonging to a hoary substratum of that language, said to be “dead”:

Eadem mutata resurgo
	
They were the words of some Southern officer taken prisoner, jotted down by a Northern correspondent on the road from Atlanta to Savannah. Tian An could not guess its meaning or pronunciation, but there was no need to read aloud anymore. His audience had fallen asleep.
	“Mr. Sweezy,” he called out to the sunken form sprawled across the ottoman on the other side of the room.
	“Huh, hmm…ah!” responded the form, the stem of an opium pipe still resting upon its lips, “You may retire, Charlie. Good night.”
two columns of newsprint receded into the dying firelight like a railroad.

•	At dawn, Tian An rose and went to Mr. Sweezy’s study in order to revive the fire. Mr. Sweezy was already at his desk, dressed in a sack suit, his pince-nez glinting in the pale light, presiding over a momentous shuffling of papers that was occurring in his hands. “The margin is on top of us again, Charlie. Stop by the telegraph office and gather what news you can of the war. Have everything ready for the board meeting. I shan’t tarry.”

•	Tian An stood gazing through the office front window, his visage half reflected by the glass and half immersed in the muddy world of cussing and livery beyond, framed in the hollow of a Roman arch of heavily serifed letters—“SWEEZY’S MINTS”—printed across the glass. Everything was ready for the board meeting, but Mr. Sweezy had still not come down from Harlem. [The margin was on top of them again.] At last, the errand boy emerged from the muddy tableau with news of the war: Grant’s designs on Richmond had been decisively repelled. The confederate army had encamped just five miles outside of Washington. “One telegram!” yelled out the errand boy, still scraping the sleet and mud from his coat with the valet brush. Tian An left the papers on Mr. Sweezy’s desk.  The board members would be arriving soon, and Mr. Sweezy had still not come down from Harlem. The margin was on top of them again. Tian An sat down at Mr. Sweezy’s desk and rubbed his eyes.
It was a recurring problem: improvements in farm management, spearmint oil extraction, and confectionery were steadily reducing the amount of labor, and increasing the amount of capital, required to produce one tin of Sweezy’s Mints. Labor productivity increased as a result, resulting in a steadily increasing capital to labor cost ratio. Since surplus value could only be extracted from labor, and not capital, this resulted in a steadily dwindling profit margin (and hence also the tendential fall in the rate of profit observed empirically by Smith, Mills, and Ricardo). [looking out the window…it was the same kung’an or riddle his master had given him some fifteen years earlier at Guoqing monastery on Mount Tiantai. [Suddenly the answer occurred to him.]  If we decrease price in the same proportion as marginal cost increases, then the change is offset.] [the meeting… “Second month running! Every time that margin encroaches Sweezy goes all namby-pamby!” … “Distinguished gentleman, if I may…” said Tian An, addressing the cacophonous gaggle. “What’s that? What did you say to me, boy?” “Distinguished board, if I…” “You watch your goddamn mouth, boy!” “If I may…” “We came for Sweezy, not his whipping boy!” Tian An explained to the board the solution to the kung’an of diminishing profit margins. cigar smoke and brandy…   ] [a cadence]

•	[Vanished in a cloud of cigar smoke…after a long time of staring distractedly at an envelope on the table,] it occurred to him that this was the telegraph envelope. It slowly dawned on him that the envelope was addressed to him.   It was an imperial summons to the Ningbo left garrison of the Ever Victorious Army. “All is forgiven,” read the last line.



	Captain Tian An looked up into the deepening azure of the autumn evening, ringed in the west by the last strains of vermillion color, permeated by the crisp scent of burning oak and sassafras fires.  For a split second he allowed himself to gaze upon the pearl necklace of a passing lady, then averted his gaze to the path of damp leaves.
	He sighed to himself when he was on the train again, disjointed moments that do not match up, taken and strung together just like these pearls on that necklace, shifting banks of mist and steam, held in the grip of some invisible thrall, obscure in origin and obscure in ending, revealing only a coquettish glimpse of what lies beyond.  And yet something compels us to go through with it…some invisible force…
	Like this, Captain Tian An let his thoughts drift off into the dark back alleys of his own mind without resolving, preferring that they not accrete into an idée fixe that color his thinking.  It was well enough that at the edge of the river the water slow and gather into eddies, but more important was letting the eddy dissolve and merge once more with the main current of life.
	But the invisible force that compels us is not love, concluded the Captain, pulling the train of thought back into focus just as it was about to dissolve into oblivion.

Swirling banks of steam and mist billow like curtains in an open window, revealing coquettish glimpses of what lies beyond.
	A telegraph pole.  A back alley.  A pile of garbage.  A dog tied to a post.  A telegraph pole.  A corpse…
	A paroxysm.
	Captain Tian An’s heart feels like it is going to explode.  He cannot breathe.  The swirling curtains of steam and fog clear for just a moment, revealing a glimpse of what lies beyond: a body lies at the bottom of a telegraph pole, two or three cannibals hunched over with smirched faces, picking the horrible vittles from the bone.
	When Tian An came to again he was pulling into the main terminal.



II. Integrity Protecting the Works of Man

•	Viceroy Earl Li Hongzhang gazed down his crooked beard into the reeking wind blowing up from Shanghai harbor, a golden pheasant rising up from the silk appliqué flowers and mountains and banks of mist emblazoned upon his chest. [, all a-sway in the grip of some invisible thrall  the yellow coat of Qing enfeoffment]. Tian An ascended the harbor and paid his respects. Li Hongzhang made no gesture in return, taking notice of the bald spot at the back of Tian An’s head where there was no Manchu queue.

•	A carriage took them to Ningbo, where General Zeng Guofan emerged from a six story building attached to a telegraph wire—like a kite attached to the end of a string—two dragons ascending the silk appliqué mountains and banks of mist emblazoned upon his chest, the countless junks and sampans of an inland navy bobbing distantly in the river behind him, collecting about his shoulders, reminiscent of the shoulder boards of US officers. It seemed no one would speak; and then a terrible howling sound filled the sky, and everyone looked up at the telegraph wire, which cleft the sky in two. At last, Li Hongzhang spoke up: “I wonder if it is true what the peasants say—that those are the howls of our ancestors, expressing displeasure with the invasion of so many Western gadgets.”
“When I wrote the telegram,” said General Zeng Guofan, “the Taiping rebels were threatening Shanghai and we were short of commanders. But that is not why I sent for you. I cannot rest in peace until I see the House of Tian restored. You will grow the Manchu queue again and rule the seven prefectureships of your father in Shaanxi. A daughter of Thieu is waiting for you in Peking.”

•	Later on, they were standing on the deck of a sampan, the cliffs and forests of the Yangze drifting by like clouds, engorged with corpses.
“This was my assurance to your father just before he passed away,” said the General, “It gave him peace. Now I cannot abide in peace until I have fulfilled the promise.”
Tian An bowed, and was about to make a solemn statement about it being the prerogative of every man, aristocrat or commoner, to abjure the red dust. But before he could speak, the General gave a signal, and two attendants stepped forward carrying a heavy damask battle gown and armor plating, followed by two more attendants carrying a sword, bow, and quiver of arrows, which Tian An recognized as his father’s.
The riverbank grew more and more engorged with the dead, collecting into little cairns here and there, sliding over each other into the river.
“How many lives has the campaign for Nanjing cost so far?” asked Tian An.
“It reminds me of the famous poem, don’t you remember,” said General Zeng Guofan, whose thoughts were elsewhere:

Floating Jade Mountain surges upward, water beats on every side!
	Jiao Cliffs’ pine trees tower high, just like the Isles of Paradise!
	This panorama of the Yangze River, continuous, past and present:
Such wild waves, could anyone pole a boat out there right now?

“I regret only that your father did not live to see the Revival at Midcourse.”

•	They reached the encampment outside of Nanjing by nightfall. Tian An lit a lamp in his campaign tent and observed the twin dragons ascending the silk appliqué mountains and clouds emblazoned across the breast of his father’s damask battle gown, indicating the rank of beile or Lord of Arrows. He took out an ink block, brush, and parchment, and executed calligraphy.
When General Zeng Guofan came for him at dawn, he found only the calligraphy—An, the character for peace—pinned to the twin dragons of his father’s battle gown, slightly aflutter in the breeze aroused by mustering troops. Zeng Guofan correctly understood that this was the epitaph of the House of Tian, and desisted. Search parties were dispatched, but no real effort expended to capture Tian An. Nanjing fell, and General Zeng Guofan was made Marquis Yiyong First Class, with the right to bear the double-eyed peacock feather. After putting down the Taiping Rebellion, he put down the Nian and Miao rebellions, and then retired to a quiet room and died.

•	The lone figure 

He pondered the words of his Master:
“The mundane world is only good for approximating zero without ever reaching zero.  Each new insight into the reality of Buddhanature cuts the reality of Buddhanature in two.  Therefore, with each step forward, you have cut away half of the truth.  How, then, will you achieve it?  I do not think Shishuang’s one-hundred foot pole can be cut down.”
“I have climbed to the very top of the pole,” said Tian An when he reached Guoqing Temple at the top of Tiantai Peak, nestled among the nine peaks of the Jiuhuashan.
“If that is true, then you are only halfway there. Reply, and you risk one hundred blows of my staff,” replied the Master.


Continuing upstream from Nanjing, the Yangze cuts southwest into Anhui Province.  It is then another day’s journey overland to the Jiuhuashan and the Tiantai Peak.  The pagodas and curling eaves of Guoqing Temple reach up through flowers and mountains and banks of mist, as though riding above the invisible thrall that holds the world below in its sway.
The sound of bells and wooden mallets is heard through the mist.  It is the hour of kung-an training.
The Forty-sixth Case. Master Shishuang said: from the top of a pole one-hundred feet high, how do you step forward? [Someone else commented that even after climbing to the top of a one-hundred foot pole and attaining enlightenment, the practitioner of the Way has still not attained enlightenment.  He must step forward from the top of the one-hundred foot pole and manifest his whole body in the ten directions.]
When the truth appears at last it has the character of both affirming and negating itself.  I do not think it can be achieved, said the Master.
[I am ready to cut down Shishuang’s one-hundred foot pole, said Tian An when he was seated before the Master at Guoqing Temple during the hour of kung-an training.]
However, I have no desire for things to resolve. I followed the thread of rumors to its source, but the sought-after item was not in its reputed place. Years ago, I shouted my name; still, no one responds.
The temple gongs and wooden mallets call the monks to evening meditation.  No one takes notice of the lone figure who hurries down the path leading away from the temple, down into the thrall of clouds and banks of mist.

Too affected. Why is Mr. Sweezy sourcing spearmint from the Carolinas, when the best growing conditions are right there in New York?

*	*	*



One night Tian An awoke to the piercing howl of a thousand tormented souls.
	Now the moment has come, he shouted, and leapt out of bed!
	I will save all the wandering souls of samsara!
	When he reached the source of the piercing screams, however, there were no suffering souls in sight. There was only a lone telegraph wire that cleft the star-filled sky, emitting the piercing howl of a thousand tormented souls, sustained at the top of a telegraph pole.
	Hanging his head in disappointment, he saw at the bottom of the pole a man famished to the bone, dead or very near to death. It then occurred to him that the dying man was him, and that he was a ghost, that this whole notion of his being a saint hidden away in the wilderness was no more than a dream. He ran and leapt and skipped away [down the railway], elated to be a ghost. Eternal lightness

•	Grant…
•	A terrible howling filled the sky, and everyone looked up at the telegraph wire, which cleft the sky in two.
“I wonder if it is true, what the peasants say,” said Li Hongzhang. END

Unconditional Surrender Ex-President General Grant was on the train from Tianjin to Peking with his wife Julia and Viceroy Li Hongzhang, peering into the swirling banks of dust and steam, trying to catch some glimpse of what lay beyond, drawing comparisons between the carnage that stretched out before him and the carnage at Antietem Creek or Vicksburg.  But the scale of mortality in the Taiping Rebellion outstripped comprehension itself: forty million, fifty million dead? The cadence, the telegraph pole,… The presentation of gifts, cigars in jade boxes, Julia’s embroidery, picture books, brandy, and so forth, quick on the uptake, he raises his glass in a toast to Integrity and the Works of Man.
Say, Li, boy, why are there no roofs on these houses?
I don’t know Mr. President, said Li Hongzhang.
Well hell why don’t you get out and ask boy!
The train wheezes and coughs and comes to a halt at Ex-President Unconditional Surrender General Grant’s word.
Li Hongzhang descends the steps of the train and approaches an old man in tatters.
Hail, dear grandpa, tell me! says Li Hongzhang, Foreign brother President General Grant is on vacation in this area and would like to know why there are no roofs on the houses in this area!
Just then a strong wind blows, and the sound of the howling of a thousand tormented souls fills the dust-filled sky.  An invisible hand pushes aside the curtain of dust and steam, revealing a glimpse of what lies beyond…
Li, boy, that’ll do!
One is grateful, Mr. President...
The poor have eaten the roofs of their houses, Mr. President, because there is famine in this area.
I beg your pardon!
Look, Julia, there at the bottom of the telegraph pole, what do you see there?
Li, boy, get back on the train!
Beastly wretches!
One feels blessed, Mr. President…
There at the bottom of the telegraph pole a corpse.  Two or three cannibals hunched over the corpse at the bottom of the telegraph pole with smirched faces, picking the horrible vittles from the bone.
There is famine in this area.
Ha!  Why, I’ll be damned!  Did you hear that Julia?
The heat is stifling.
One feels blessed for the possession of improved weapons, Mr. President…
Eating their houses!  Ha!  I’ll be damned!
You watch your mouth Ulysses!
Li, boy, get back on the train goddamnit!
God has forsaken them!  Ulysses, let us abandon this wretched place at once!
One feels blessed for the possession of improved weapons, Mr. President, for without them mobs of starving people might overrun the train, attracted by the smell of food.
The coughing and wheezing of the train began again, the dragon picked up strength.
Li, boy, get back on the train goddamnit!
Li Hongzhang clasps his hands beneath yellow sleeves and gazes up at the lone telegraph wire that cleft the sky, emitting the piercing howl of a thousand tormented souls, sustained at the top of a pole.
I wonder if it is true what they say, marvels Li Hongzhang, that the howling noise is the sound of tormented souls displeased with the incursion of Western novelties.
