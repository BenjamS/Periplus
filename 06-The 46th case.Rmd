The 46th case


I. Revival at Midcourse

The columns of newsprint receded into the dying firelight like railroad tracks; and Tian An’s nightly reading of the news sputtered and stalled like a locomotive pulling into the station, his eyes beginning to lose their hold on the rails of newsprint, drifting across the page, until they snagged upon one of those peculiar phrases that periodically confounded his precarious mastery of the English language—achieved after some twenty-five years of Sysiphean effort—one of those phrases written with English characters but said to belong to a hoary substratum of that language, said to be “dead”:

Eadem mutata resurgo.
	
They were the words of some Southern officer taken prisoner, defiant in surrender, jotted down by a Union correspondent on the road from Atlanta to Savannah. Tian An could not guess its meaning or pronunciation; but there was no need to read aloud anymore. His audience had fallen asleep.
	“Mr. Sweezy,” he whispered out to the sunken form sprawled across the ottoman on the other side of the room.
	“Huh, hmm…ah!” responded the form, the stem of an opium pipe still resting upon its lips, “You may retire, Charlie. Good night.”

	At dawn, Tian An rose and went to Mr. Sweezy’s study in order to revive the fire. Mr. Sweezy was already at his desk, dressed in a sack suit, his pince-nez glinting in the pale winter light, presiding over a momentous shuffling of papers that was occurring in his hands. “The margin is on top of us again, Charlie. Stop by the telegraph office and gather what news you can of the war. Have everything ready for the board meeting. I shan’t tarry.”

Tian An caught the trolley down to Manhattan, observing the sonorous click-clack of the track and telegram poles passing by in polyrhythm, marking the cadence of the perplexing world in which he had chosen to immerse himself [encompassed within the finite radius of his consciousness]: A telegraph pole. Click-clack. Click-a pile of garbage-clack.  A dog-click-tied to a post-clack. A telegraph pole. Click-clack. A cadence.
	Later on, he stood gazing through Mr. Sweezy’s office front window, his visage half reflected by the glass and half immersed in the muddy world of cussing and livery beyond, framed in the hollow of a Roman arch of heavily serifed letters—“SWEEZY’S MINTS”—printed across the storefront glass. Everything was ready for the board meeting, but Mr. Sweezy had still not come down from Harlem. (The margin was on top of them again.) At last, the errand boy emerged from the muddy tableau with news of the war: Grant’s designs on Richmond had been decisively repelled. The confederate army had encamped just five miles outside of Washington. “And one telegram!” yelled out the errand boy, still scraping the sleet and mud from his coat with the valet brush. Tian An deposited the newspaper and telegram on the conference table, rested his hands on the back of an empty chair, and heaved a pitiful sigh. The board members would be arriving soon, and Mr. Sweezy had still not come down from Harlem. The margin was on top of them again.
It was a recurring problem: improvements in farm management, spearmint oil extraction, and confectionery were incessantly reducing the amount of labor, and/or increasing the amount of capital, required to produce one tin of Sweezy’s Mints. Labor productivity increased as a result, resulting in a steadily increasing capital to labor cost ratio. Since surplus value could only be extracted from labor, and not capital, this resulted in a steadily dwindling profit margin (and hence also the tendential fall in the rate of profit observed empirically by Smith, Mills, and Ricardo).
	“Every time the margin encroaches, Sweezy goes all namby-pamby!”
	“Goddamnit, where’s Sweezy!”
	The board members had begun to arrive and fill the empty chairs around the conference table; and Mr. Sweezy had still not come down from his estate in Harlem. Tian An would have to address the board by himself.
	“Distinguished gentleman, if I may…” said Tian An.
	“What’s that? What did you say to me, boy?”
	“Distinguished board, if I…”
	“You watch your goddamn mouth, boy!”
	“We came for Sweezy, not his whipping boy!”
Tian An had long marveled at the semblance between the problem of the margin and the last riddle (kung’an) his master had given him some twenty-five years earlier at the monastery on Mount Tiantai [Guoquing monastery]: The Forty-Sixth Case—from the top of a pole one-hundred feet high, how do you step forward? As he surveyed the cussing, cacophonous gaggle of board members, he felt the boundary between himself and theirs dissolve, and observed the scene—from no vantage point in particular and from them all—as a mosaic woven onto the hem of the garment of some cosmic, dancing demigod. The solution blossomed from deep within his being, or rather was his being.—We must with humility acknowledge the limits of language to describe such events. Even the board was overcome by the sensation that something odd and momentous, and yet nothing particular at all, had happened, and their cussing ebbed like a wave retreating back into the sea. And when it had done so, Tian An shared his solution to the kung’an of the margin.
“Instead of mincing your steps in vain effort to never reach the end of the line, just look up from your feet! You will notice that you traverse not a straight line, but the circumference of a circle of infinite radius. When you realize this, you realize that—by a geometric inversion—marginally diminishing increments and equally spaced increments are the same. So, choose your increment, and solve for the price that makes it so! Whether or not you hold infinity in the palm of your hand is your [decision] business. It is like choosing whether to wear a red or blue hanky today. What will you choose? Do you look up and take the reins of the universe in your hands, or do you remain prisoner within its infinite radius, transfixed upon your mincing feet? I advise the board to consider the former course of action.”
Cigar smoke, brandy, board members slapping each other on the back, voluminous as mountains poking above the autumn mist, bawling out:
“I’ll be a monkey’s uncle!”
“I’ll be hornswoggled!”
“Sweezy’s boy done saved the business!”
The sonorous click-clack of the track and telegram poles passing by in polyrhythm, marking the cadence of the cosmic dance to which he had been privy, now receding just beyond the periphery of the infinite radius of his consciousness: A telegraph pole. Click-clack. A back alley. Click-a pile of garbage-clack.  A dog-click-tied to a post-clack.  A telegraph pole. Click-clack. A cadence.
Deepening azure of autumn evening, ringed in the west by the old vermillion wound of dusk, essence of burning oak and maple and sassafras on the night. The pearl necklace of a passing lady wrapped in blankets and furs caught his eye, which he then averted to the path of damp oak and maple and sassafras leaves. Disjointed fragments that do not match up, by turn adding up to a kind of sense, and by turns making no sense at all, taken and strung together just like these pearls on that necklace, shifting banks of fog and cigar smoke and locomotive steam, held in the grip of some invisible thrall, obscure in origin and obscure in ending, coquettish game half concealing and half revealing only a coquettish glimpse of what lies beyond.  And yet something compels us to make the pieces fit together, to go through with it…some invisible force…/Like this, Captain Tian An let his thoughts drift off into the dark back alleys of his own mind without resolving, preferring that they not accrete into an idée fixe that color his thinking. It was well enough that at the edge of the river the water slow and gather into eddies, but more important was letting the eddy dissolve and merge once more with the main current of life./But the invisible force that compels us is not love, concluded the Captain, pulling the train of thought back into focus just as it was about to dissolve into oblivion.
Directly he had arrived at Mr. Sweezy’s estate and scraped off his boots and coat, Tian An went to the study to revive the fire. Mr. Sweezy lay sprawled across the ottoman at the other end of the room, shrouded in robes and blankets, the long stem of his opium pipe listless against his bottom lip. Tian An took in hand what news of the war the errand boy could gather that day and settled into the reading chair. As he did so, the telegram… It was addressed to him, not Sweezy. It was an imperial summons to the Ningbo left garrison of the Ever Victorious Army. “All is forgiven,” read the last line.
	A telegraph pole.  A back alley.  A pile of garbage.  A dog tied to a post.  A telegraph pole.  A corpse… /A paroxysm. a body lies at the bottom of a telegraph pole, two or three cannibals hunched over with smirched faces, picking the horrible vittles from the bone./ Click-a prairie-clack, click-a city-clack, click-a prairie-clack. When Tian An came to, the vast locomotive sputtered and stalled, pulling into the Oakland Long Wharf.

II. Integrity Protecting the Works of Man

•	Viceroy Earl Li Hongzhang gazed down his crooked beard into the reeking wind blowing up from Shanghai harbor, a golden pheasant rising up from the silk appliqué flowers and mountains and banks of mist emblazoned upon his chest. [, all a-sway in the grip of some invisible thrall  the yellow coat of Qing enfeoffment]. Tian An ascended the harbor and paid his respects. Li Hongzhang made no gesture in return, taking notice of the bald spot at the back of Tian An’s head where there was no Manchu queue.

•	A carriage took them to Ningbo, where General Zeng Guofan emerged from a six story building attached to a telegraph wire—like a kite attached to the end of a string—two dragons ascending the silk appliqué mountains and banks of mist emblazoned upon his chest, the countless junks and sampans of his inland navy bobbing just above his shoulders in the river behind him like the shoulder boards of US officers. It seemed no one would speak; and then a terrible howling sound filled the sky, and everyone looked up at the offending telegraph wire, which cleft the sky in two. At last, Li Hongzhang said: “I wonder if it is true what the peasants say—that those are the howls of our ancestors, expressing displeasure with the invasion of so many Western gadgets.”
“When I wrote the telegram,” said General Zeng Guofan, “the Taiping rebels were threatening Shanghai and we were short of commanders. But that is not why I sent for you. I am old and cannot rest in peace until I see the House of Tian restored. You will grow the Manchu queue again and rule the seven prefectureships of your father in Shaanxi. A daughter of Thieu awaits you in Peking.”

•	Later on, they were standing on the deck of a sampan, the cliffs and forests of the Yangze drifting by like clouds, engorged with corpses.
“This was my assurance to your father just before he passed away,” said the General, “It gave him peace. Now that it is my turn to grow old and die, I cannot abide in peace until I have fulfilled the promise.”
Tian An bowed, and was about to make a solemn statement about it being the prerogative of every man, aristocrat or commoner, to abjure the red dust. But before he could speak, the General gave a signal, and two attendants stepped forward carrying a heavy damask battle gown and armor plating, followed by two more attendants carrying a sword, bow, and quiver of arrows, which Tian An had not seen since he was a child [recognized as his father’s].
The riverbank grew more and more engorged with the dead, collecting into little cairns here and there, sliding over each other into the river.
“How many lives has the campaign for Nanjing cost so far?” asked Tian An.
“It reminds me of the famous poem, don’t you remember,” said General Zeng Guofan, whose thoughts were elsewhere:

Floating Jade Mountain surges upward, water beats on every side!
	Jiao Cliffs’ pine trees tower high, just like the Isles of Paradise!
	This panorama of the Yangze River, continuous, past and present:
Such wild waves, could anyone pole a boat out there right now?

“I regret only that your father did not live to see the Revival at Midcourse.”

•	They reached the encampment outside of Nanjing by nightfall. Tian An lit a lamp in his campaign tent and observed the twin dragons ascending the silk appliqué mountains and clouds emblazoned across the breast of his father’s damask battle gown, indicating the rank of beile or Lord of Arrows. He took out an ink block, brush, and parchment, and executed calligraphy.
When General Zeng Guofan came for him at dawn, he found only the calligraphy—An, the character for peace—pinned to the twin dragons of his father’s battle gown, slightly aflutter in the breeze aroused by mustering troops. Zeng Guofan correctly understood that this was the epitaph of the House of Tian, and desisted. Search parties were dispatched, but no real effort expended to capture Tian An. Nanjing fell, and General Zeng Guofan was made Marquis Yiyong First Class, with the right to bear the double-eyed peacock feather. After putting down the Taiping Rebellion, he put down the Nian and Miao rebellions, and then retired to a quiet room and died.

•	The lone figure

He pondered the words of his Master:
“The mundane world is only good for approximating zero without ever reaching zero.  Each new insight into the reality of Buddhanature cuts the reality of Buddhanature in two.  Therefore, with each step forward, you have cut away half of the truth.  How, then, will you achieve it?  I do not think Shishuang’s one-hundred foot pole can be cut down.”
“I have climbed to the very top of the pole,” said Tian An when he reached Guoqing Temple at the top of Tiantai Peak, nestled among the nine peaks of the Jiuhuashan.
“If that is true, then you are only halfway there. Reply, and you risk one hundred blows of my staff,” replied the Master.


Continuing upstream from Nanjing, the Yangze cuts southwest into Anhui Province.  It is then another day’s journey overland to the Jiuhuashan and the Tiantai Peak.  The pagodas and curling eaves of Guoqing Temple reach up through flowers and mountains and banks of mist, as though riding above the invisible thrall that holds the world below in its sway.
The sound of bells and wooden mallets is heard through the mist.  It is the hour of kung-an training.
The Forty-sixth Case. Master Shishuang said: from the top of a pole one-hundred feet high, how do you step forward? [Someone else commented that even after climbing to the top of a one-hundred foot pole and attaining enlightenment, the practitioner of the Way has still not attained enlightenment.  He must step forward from the top of the one-hundred foot pole and manifest his whole body in the ten directions.]
When the truth appears at last it has the character of both affirming and negating itself.  I do not think it can be achieved, said the Master.
[I am ready to cut down Shishuang’s one-hundred foot pole, said Tian An when he was seated before the Master at Guoqing Temple during the hour of kung-an training.]
However, I have no desire for things to resolve. I followed the thread of rumors to its source, but the sought-after item was not in its reputed place. Years ago, I shouted my name; still, no one responds.
The temple gongs and wooden mallets call the monks to evening meditation.  No one takes notice of the lone figure who hurries down the path leading away from the temple, down into the thrall of clouds and banks of mist.

“Too affected” [says the master, gazing at the silk applique...] “Why is Mr. Sweezy sourcing spearmint from the Carolinas, when the best growing conditions are right there in New York?”

*	*	*



One night Tian An awoke to the piercing howl of a thousand tormented souls.
	Now the moment has come, he shouted, and leapt out of bed!
	I will save all the wandering souls of samsara!
	When he reached the source of the piercing screams, however, there were no suffering souls in sight. There was only a lone telegraph wire that cleft the star-filled sky, emitting the piercing howl of a thousand tormented souls, sustained at the top of a telegraph pole.
	Hanging his head in disappointment, he saw at the bottom of the pole a man famished to the bone, dead or very near to death. It then occurred to him that the dying man was him, and that he was a ghost. This whole notion of his being a saint hidden away in the wilderness had been no more than a dead man’s dream. He ran and leapt and skipped away [down the railway], elated to be a ghost. Eternal lightness

•	Grant…
•	A terrible howling filled the sky, and everyone looked up at the telegraph wire, which cleft the sky in two.
“I wonder if it is true, what the peasants say,” said Li Hongzhang. END

Unconditional Surrender Ex-President General Grant was on the train from Tianjin to Peking with his wife Julia and Viceroy Li Hongzhang, peering into the swirling banks of dust and steam, trying to catch some glimpse of what lay beyond, drawing comparisons between the carnage that stretched out before him and the carnage at Antietem Creek or Vicksburg.  But the scale of mortality in the Taiping Rebellion outstripped comprehension itself: forty million, fifty million dead? The cadence, the telegraph pole,… The presentation of gifts, cigars in jade boxes, Julia’s embroidery, picture books, brandy, and so forth, quick on the uptake, he raises his glass in a toast to Integrity and the Works of Man.
Say, Li, boy, why are there no roofs on these houses?
I don’t know Mr. President, said Li Hongzhang.
Well hell why don’t you get out and ask boy!
The train wheezes and coughs and comes to a halt at Ex-President Unconditional Surrender General Grant’s word.
Li Hongzhang descends the steps of the train and approaches an old man in tatters.
Hail, dear grandpa, tell me! says Li Hongzhang, Foreign brother President General Grant is on vacation in this prefecture and would like to know why there are no roofs on the houses!
Just then a strong wind blows, and the sound of the howling of a thousand tormented souls fills the dust-filled sky.  An invisible hand pushes aside the curtain of dust and steam, revealing a glimpse of what lies beyond…
Li, boy, that’ll do!
One is grateful, Mr. President...
The poor have eaten the roofs of their houses, Mr. President, because there is famine in this area.
I beg your pardon!
Look, Julia, there at the bottom of the telegraph pole, what do you see there?
Li, boy, get back on the train!
Beastly wretches!
One feels blessed, Mr. President…
There at the bottom of the telegraph pole a corpse.  Two or three cannibals hunched over the corpse at the bottom of the telegraph pole with smirched faces, picking the horrible vittles from the bone.
There is famine in this area.
Ha!  Why, I’ll be damned!  Did you hear that Julia?
The heat is stifling.
One feels blessed for the possession of improved weapons, Mr. President…
Eating their houses!  Ha!  I’ll be damned!
You watch your mouth Ulysses!
Li, boy, get back on the train goddamnit!
God has forsaken them!  Ulysses, let us abandon this wretched place at once!
One feels blessed for the possession of improved weapons, Mr. President, for without them mobs of starving people might overrun the train, attracted by the smell of food.
The coughing and wheezing of the train began again, the dragon picked up strength.
Li, boy, get back on the train goddamnit!
Li Hongzhang clasps his hands beneath yellow sleeves and gazes up at the lone telegraph wire that cleft the sky, emitting the piercing howl of a thousand tormented souls, sustained at the top of a pole.
I wonder if it is true what they say, marvels Li Hongzhang, that the howling noise is the sound of tormented souls displeased with the incursion of Western novelties.
