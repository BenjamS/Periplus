The Chinese-martial were composed of the Tai Nikan (those who followed the dragon into the pass), of whom the Fushun Nikan were a subgroup, as well as the Fu Xi Baitongga (those who were recruited into the banners after the third year of Hung Taiji’s reign as functionaries of the western conquest). Moreover, the Nikan had descended from numerous races and tribes in Liaodong, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, including Mongolian, Joeson, Jurchen, as well as several groups of northern wildmen such as Nivkhs, Ulchs, Nanays, Giliaks, Oronchons, Evenks, Sibos, Hurkas, and Warkas. Therefore, adhering to strict evidentiary methods, it was not possible to say that all Chinese-martial were originally Han.

The four-treasury imperial expeditionary office was set up on the snowy loess plain of the Tungiyya Valley, not far from Fushun, Hetu Ala, and the imperial tombs at Yongling, facing south, marshaling lineages and resolving persons of blank status.

It had not yet been possible to establish General Huwasan’s Manchuness. The genealogy submitted by the General demonstrated that he was descended from the Suwan Gulwagiya lineage of Fingdon, Sedition-purging General of Nurgaci’s reign. His grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather bore the names Sihan, Arsungga, and Bukha, and were all raised in Jianzhou. However, Sihan had migrated westward into Liaodong, diluting the purity. Upon his deathbed, Sihan confessed his error to his sons Shi Tingzhu, Shi Tianzhu, and Shi Guozhu. Shi Tingzhu, who is General Huwasan’s father, was later integrated into the Han Cherished Soldier units and thereafter mistaken for a Chinese-martial.

The dispatches arrived from the expeditionary historiographical sub-mission to the villages of Dong Ting prefecture. Thirty-two officials had been exposed as twice-serving Han and correctly divested of their powers, replaced by officials of authenticated Manchu descent.

A beile was dispatched to the Jurchen tribes around Odori. The Qianlong Emperor leaned forward on the sedan throne saying:

"What do you think, is irony right or wrong?"

x responded: "The Original Four Ancestors of Qing were Mongke Temur, Fuman, Giocangga, and Taksi, who came from Odori to the Tungiyya Valley, not far from Fushun, Hetu Ala, and Yongling, where their tombs are now erected. But this is just a tale told to children at bedtime. To get at the truth, we must follow the mighty river back up to its source!"

To which the Qianlong Emperor responded: "I remind you that failure to adhere to strict evidentiary methods carries a penalty of death."

But the imperial scholars re-examining the ancestral record could turn up no mention of the story prior to the reign of the Shunzhi emperor. Moreover, the imperial archives kept before that time were written in an earlier form of Manchu that they could comprehend only through extraordinary mental exertion. Even then, they could find no mention of ‘Manchu’ or ‘Qing’ until the ninth year of the reign of the Purity Accomplished Emperor. And prior to that, the records became completely indecipherable to them, written as they were in an obscure Mongolian dialect which was no longer spoken anywhere in the world.

The beile dispatched to Odori returned with the news that the Jurchen tribes did not consider the Qing their ancestral brothers, nor true Jin. The Jurchen of Odori are not Jin Jurchen, but rather Jianzhou Jurchen. The true Jin Jurchen come from farther east in Jilin. As for the common ancestor Bikuri Yungson, they recognized the name, but said that he is a sacred mountain, not far from Mount Changbai, and not a person.

The Qianlong Emperor balked, saying: "Then there are no Jin among the Jurchen tribes from Heilongjiang to Jilin. Qing are originally Manchu, Manchu are originally Later Jin, Later Jin are originally Jurchen. Jurchen are originally Early Jin."

Even as these sayings were extolled and queued for transcription by aides and scribes, the Emperor added: “How much longer until we get to Mount Sanggiyan?”
They could not find it. The local people of the area had never heard of such a place. Nor had anyone heard of Lake Tamun. There was a large mountain to the northeast, but it was called different things by different people. Tutai, Buxian shan, Taibai, Changbai, Baitou shan, Paek’t u san….
“The people, being uncultured, cannot know of our high evidentiary standards.”
These sayings extolled with fine phrases and queued for codification, the Emperor reclined and declaimed verse from his Ode to Mukden late into the night.

Diderot walked a long ways out beneath the dragon eaves, and collapsed to his knees in a heap of snow, studying his tears in the lantern light as they mixed with soot and ash on the backs of his hands. The universe itself was a library, then, housing infinite encyclopaediae, each of which enumerated and explained every last thing; and yet each of which was distinct from the other; and yet each of which described the same universe, the contents of which were themselves encyclopediae. The Encyclopaedia had been complete without his ever starting it. Now that he had started it, however, it would never be possible to finish.

<!-- Ever since departing Samarkand, his journey East had been populated by all of the things not included in his Encyclopaedia; and he had considered inlcuding an article on the Encyclopaedia itself as a catchall measure. Now, at the Qianlong Emperor's court, he encountered his Encyclopedia among the omissions in his Encyclopedia. -->
