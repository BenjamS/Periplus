The Chinese-martial were composed of the Tai Nikan (those who followed the dragon into the pass), of whom the Fushun Nikan were a subgroup, as well as the Fu Xi Baitongga (those who were recruited into the banners after the third year of Hung Taiji’s reign as functionaries of the western conquest). Moreover, the Nikan had descended from numerous races and tribes in Liaodong, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, including Mongolian, Joeson, Jurchen, as well as several groups of northern wildmen such as Nivkhs, Ulchs, Nanays, Giliaks, Oronchons, Evenks, Sibos, Hurkas, and Warkas. Therefore, adhering to strict evidentiary methods, it was not possible to say that all Chinese-martial were originally Han.
The four-treasury imperial expeditionary office was set up on the snowy loess plain of the Tungiyya Valley, not far from Fushun, Hetu Ala, and the imperial tombs at Yongling, facing south, marshaling lineages and resolving persons of blank status.
It had not yet been possible to establish General Huwasan’s Manchuness. The genealogy submitted by the General demonstrated that he was descended from the Suwan Gulwagiya lineage of Fingdon, Sedition-purging General of Nurgaci’s reign. His grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather bore the names Sihan, Arsungga, and Bukha, and were all raised in Jianzhou. However, Sihan had migrated westward into Liaodong, diluting the purity. Upon his deathbed, Sihan confessed his error to his sons Shi Tingzhu, Shi Tianzhu, and Shi Guozhu. Shi Tingzhu, who is General Huwasan’s father, was later integrated into the Han Cherished Soldier units and thereafter mistaken for a Chinese-martial.
The dispatches arrived from the expeditionary historiographical sub-mission to the villages of Dong Ting prefecture. Thirty-two officials had been exposed as twice-serving Han and correctly divested of their powers, replaced by officials of authenticated Manchu descent.
A beile was dispatched to the Jurchen tribes around Odori. The Qianlong Emperor leaned forward on the sedan throne saying:
“What do you think, is irony right or wrong?”
And: “The Original Four Ancestors of Qing were Mongke Temur, Fuman, Giocangga, and Taksi, who came from Odori to the Tungiyya Valley, not far from Fushun, Hetu Ala, and Yongling, where their tombs are now erected. But this is just a tale told to children at bedtime. To get at the truth, we must follow the mighty river back up to its source! I remind you that failure to adhere to strict evidentiary methods carries a penalty of death.”
But the imperial scholars re-examining the ancestral record could turn up no mention of the story prior to the reign of the Shunzhi emperor. Moreover, the imperial archives kept before that time were written in an earlier form of Manchu that they could comprehend only through extraordinary mental exertion. Even then, they could find no mention of ‘Manchu’ or ‘Qing’ until the ninth year of the reign of the Purity Accomplished Emperor. And prior to that, the records became completely indecipherable to them, written as they were in an obscure Mongolian dialect which was no longer spoken anywhere in the world.
A Yi army deployed 30 li to the south, suing for guarantees that the Qing expedition would not cross the Changbai range into Joeson territory.
The beile dispatched to Odori returned with the news that the Jurchen tribes did not consider the Qing their ancestral brothers, nor true Jin. The Jurchen of Odori are not Jin Jurchen, but rather Jianzhou Jurchen. The true Jin Jurchen come from farther east in Jilin. As for the common ancestor Bikuri Yungson, they recognized the name, but said that it is a sacred mountain, not far from Mount Changbai, and not a man.
The Qianlong Emperor balked, saying: “Then there are no Jin among the Jurchen tribes from Heilongjiang to Jilin. Qing are originally Manchu, Manchu are originally Later Jin, Later Jin are originally Jurchen. Jurchen are originally Early Jin.”
Even as these sayings were extolled and queued for transcription by aides and scribes, the Emperor added: “How much longer until we get to Mount Sanggiyan?”
They could not find it. The local people of the area had never heard of such a place. Nor had anyone heard of Lake Tamun. There was a large mountain to the northeast, but it was called different things by different people. Tutai, Buxian shan, Taibai, Changbai, Baitou shan, Paek’t u san….
“The people, being uncultured, cannot know of our high evidentiary standards.”
These sayings extolled with fine phrases and queued for codification, the Emperor reclined and declaimed verse from his Ode to Mukden late into the night.

The Qianlong Emperor was holding court on the snowy loess plain of the Tungiyya Valley, facing south, not far from Fushun, Hetu Ala, and the imperial tombs at Yongling, organizing lineages and resolving persons of blank status.  It was the Qing Four Treasuries Evidentiary Expedition of the Source Returning Splendor Great Righteousness Resolving Confusion and Dispelling Darkness, Distinguishing Yes from No, Before from After, Light from Dark, Base from Erudite, Reality from Artifice, Authentic from Forgery, High Culture from Low Culture, Classics from Non-classics, Literature from Trash, Art from Non-art, Fiction from Non-fiction, and Rendering Clear What Had Been Obscure, Uniting What Had Seemed Separate, and Revealing What Had Seemed Hidden.
“What do you think,” said the Qianlong Emperor, “is irony right or wrong?”
	A Four Treasuries Official with the golden pheasant on his robe stood and replied, “No, your Majesty, it is not.”
	The Qianlong Emperor was not satisfied with this answer.
Another Four Treasuries Official with the golden pheasant sewn to his robe stood and made another reply, “Irony is a most unfortunate incursion of the foreign devil into Qing sovereignty.  Just see how the European countries are suffering, not knowing night from day.  In lands where there is irony, there is always rebellion, confusion, and despair.”
“Is there no one in this court,” said the Qianlong Emperor, much displeased, “who has a firm notion of what irony is?”
The Qianlong Emperor drew himself up slightly and said, “I am now going to read the dispatches.  It is irony because I am not really going to read the dispatches.  That is Xiahou Dun’s job.”
“Excellent, your Majesty,” proclaimed all the court officials in chorus, “it is irony indeed!  You are a master of irony!”
“Bring in Fong Hu,” said the Qianlong Emperor.

An army deployed thirty li from the Qing camp, blocking the way to Odori.
	“Who are they?” asked the Qianlong Emperor.
	“They say they are the Jin Jurchen.”
	“Tell them we are also Jin, we are their ancestral brothers and they have no reason to oppose us.”
	“They call us Jilin Jurchen and say they do not consider us their ancestral brothers.”
The Qianlong Emperor rose from his sedan throne and walked a long ways out into the snow.
“As the Yalu River pours into the sea it has no thought of its source,” he said.
He then ordered Xiahou Dun to divide his force into two wings and attack the enemy.

The Qianlong Emperor was in the Chamber of the Pure Adornments of the Essential Nature of the Cosmos of Realities.  He dismissed the eunuchs and meditated a while, unable to find peace.  The blizzard howled beneath the eaves of the Imperial Litter, perturbing him.  From beneath the chaise pillow at his back he pulled out a favorite childhood plaything of his: a lacquered Duobao ge box, with many cabinets of different shapes and sizes opening onto shiny fetishes and trinkets.  One by one he opened their little doors and delighted in the contents of each cabinet: jades, ivories, cloisonnés, miniature books and paintings, mirrors.  In one cabinet he found a painting of himself.  It was no larger than a playing card, and was accompanied by a variety of glass cases that were themselves painted with the headdresses and outfits of different characters from various walks of life, which could be slid over the portrait of the Emperor to give him make-believe aspects.  One by one, the Qianlong Emperor slid the different glass cases over his portrait and delighted in the various guises of a Tang Dynasty scholar, a Song era official, a Taoist recluse, a Shaolin monk….
“Your Majesty!” called out a eunuch from the other side of the paper screens, “we have reached Tamun Lake!”
	The Qianlong Emperor placed the shiny treasures back in their respective cabinets, closed the little doors, and stuck the Duobao ge box behind the chaise pillow at his back.
	At the clap of his hands the eunuchs slid back the paper screens and entered the chamber.  Poles were slung through the rings at the base of the sedan throne and the Emperor was lifted onto their shoulders and brought down to the front gate of the Source Returning Splendor Imperial Litter.  A troupe of lamas assembled there blew a deep, resounding note on their horns and the screen gate was slid back.  A thick sheet of ice had frozen over the entrance, blocking the way forward.  The lamas blew their horns again, shattering the ice.  A balustraded parapet was fixed to the front gate with wooden pegs and the sedan throne descended the steps as fluidly as a silk shawl.
	The Four Treasuries Officials were assembled at the edge of the Lake.  They extended their hands in the direction of the billowing curtains of snow and ice and exclaimed, “You Majesty!  Tamun Lake!”
	The Qianlong Emperor gazed upon the falling curtains of snow and ice, beyond which nothing could be seen.
	Qaidu Boke stepped forward and said, “How uncanny the likeness, Your Majesty.  It’s just as you described it in your Ode to Mukden.”
	The attendants brought forth ink stones, brushes, and rice paper, but the Qianlong Emperor waved them off.
	Xiahou Dun stepped forward and said, “Your Majesty, we’d better continue on.  We lost half our men on the ascent.”

“What do you think?” said the Qianlong Emperor, “Is General Huwasan Manchu or Han Chinese?”
“Your Majesty, General Huwasan has presented a genealogy demonstrating that he is descended from the Suwan Gulwagiya lineage of Fingdon, Sedition-purging General of Nurgaci’s reign.  He thereby demonstrates that his great-great-grandfather had the Manchu name Bukha, that his great-grandfather had the name Arsungga, and his grandfather the name Sihan.  All of them, he demonstrates, were raised in Jianzhou.  Sihan migrated westward into Liaodong, but on his deathbed he expressed his deep regret for having done so.  He expressed his regret to his sons Shi Tingzhu, Shi Tianzhu, and Shi Guozhu.  Shi Tingzhu, who is Huwasan’s father, was later integrated into the Han Cherished Soldier units and thereafter mistaken for a Chinese-martial.”
“Nonetheless,” said the Qianlong Emperor, “if Huwasan’s genealogy cannot be vetted through strict evidentiary methods then it cannot be admitted as proof of Huwasan’s Manchuness.  All Chinese-martial are originally Han.”
“Your Majesty, appraising the matter squarely, the Chinese-martial are composed of those who followed the dragon into the pass, the Tai Nikan, of whom the Fushun Nikan are a subgroup, and those who were recruited into the banners after the third year of Hung Taiji’s reign as functionaries of the western conquest, the Fu Xi Baitongga.  Moreover, the Nikan are descended from numerous races and tribes in Liaodong, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, including Mongolian, Joeson, Jurchen, and several groups of northern wildmen such as Nivkhs, Ulchs, Nanays, Giliaks, Oronchons, Evenks, Sibos, Hurkas, and Warkas.  Therefore, adhering to strict evidentiary methods, it is not possible to say that all Chinese-martial are originally Han.”
“Present today’s dispatches from the Imperial Historiographical Office,” said the Qianlong Emperor.
“In the villages of Dong Ting prefecture, 4,029 persons of blank status were assigned to lineages, while 1,229 persons of mistaken descent were resolved to their proper lineage.  Of the officials and magistrates in this area, 32 were designated ‘twice-serving’ Han and correctly divested of their powers, replaced by officials of authenticated Manchu descent.  In this way the Great Source-returning Righteousness has distinguished right from wrong, true from false, fiction from non-fiction, good art from bad art, high culture from low-brow tastes, serious literature from trash, and has wholly banished all trace of confusion from the land through the application of strict evidentiary criteria.”
Yi emissaries arrived, suing for guarantees that the Qing expedition would not cross the Yalu River into Joeson territory.
The Qianlong Emperor then adjourned court but remained seated on his sedan throne in the Celestial Hall of the Imperial Litter, reciting verses from his Ode to Mukden long into the night.  The assembled eunuchs, scribes, and courtiers extolled his verse with fine phrases.

This was at the time of the establishment of the Seven Libraries of the Imperial Office of the Four Treasuries (siku quanshu) and its parallel bureaucracy of evidentiary writers and historiographers, enfeoffed with the task of distinguishing yes from no, before from after, light from dark, good from evil, base from erudite, reality from artifice, authentic from forgery, high culture from low culture, classics from non-classics, literature from trash, art from non-art, fiction from non-fiction, rendering clear what is obscure, uniting what is separate, and revealing what is hidden.  The “First Edition of the General History of the Eight Banners” (Baqi tongzhi) and “The Collected Geneaologies of the Eight Banner and Manchu Lineage” (Manjusai mukun hala be uheri ejehe bithe, Baqi manzhou shizu tongpu) had just recently been completed and sent to the Imperial Historiographical Office for publishing.  The Qianlong Emperor’s “Ode to Mukden” (Mukdun i fujurun bithe) based on Umuna’s “Finding Mount Changbai” (Feng Changbaishan) which had been commissioned during the x year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1677), was being widely distributed throughout the empire.  The latest project—“Biographies of the Twice-Serving Ministers” (Echen zhuan)—was just getting underway.
It reminds me of the poem by Da Chongguang, don’t you remember?

The music of autumn along the path to the Stone Pavilion,
Distant mist and clouds reflect blue-green peaks in the cold.
On the horizon a crane returns from the evening;
	I can also see good friends approaching the place by the river bank.

The Qing imperial litter lay on the snowy plain.  The Changbai range rose up in the distance.  Additional Right, Left, and Rear wings were attached to the main litter.  A tall yellow banner snapping in the wind proclaims: Source Returning Magnificence.  The Qianlong Emperor ascended the sedan throne in the Celestial Hall of the Source Returning Magnificence Splendor Imperial Litter, and faced south, holding court.
“Having reached Mukden and then the ancestral tombs at Yongling, not far from Hetu Ala, we are now in Ningudda, the exact original spot of Emperor Nurgaci and the Six Princes.  Odori, the ancestral home of all Manchu, lies in Jianzhou, on the other side of the Yalu River.  Jianzhou is called Joeson by the Yi.”
Emissaries arrived from the Yi dynasty to the south, securing guarantees that the Qing expedition would not cross the Changbai range into Joeson territory.
“Your Majesty, an army has deployed thirty li from our camp.”
“Jianzhou Jurchen are not originally Jin Jurchen.”
“All Chinese-martial are originally Han,” said the Qianlong Emperor.
The Four Treasuries Official then added: “Your Majesty, Nikan Chinese are distinct from Han Chinese, and Chinese-martial are distinct from Nikan Chinese.  Therefore, Chinese-martial are not originally Han Chinese.  If evidentiary righteousness is to overcome confusion and evil then it will be necessary to arrive at the truth of the matter.”
The Qianlong emperor then issued the following edict:
Han existing Chinese are not originally Han non-existing Chinese.  Some Manchu are twice-existing.  Not all twice-existing Manchu are originally Manchu.  Reorganize the banners accordingly, in keeping with the strictest evidentiary methods.
One of the Lords of Arrows who was present reached his hand into the boiling pot, pulled out a fistful of noodles, and threw it on the floor.
“That is our lineage,” he gruffed.
The Qianlong Emperor sent him together with a beile of 100 Source Returning Delegates to announce the Source Returning and Darkness Dispelling Qing Great Righteousness to the Jurchen peoples around Odori, who are the ancestral brothers of the Manchu Qing.
	The Qianlong Emperor then adjourned court and spent the remainder of the evening reciting verses from his long poem Ode to Mukden, which the assembled eunuchs and courtiers extolled with fine phrases such as the “child is the father of the man” and so on.

*	*	*

“The Original Four Ancestors of Qing were Mongke Temur, Fuman, Giocangga, and Taksi, who came from Odori to the Tungiyya Valley, where their tombs are now erected.”
“That is the tale that has been passed on for generation upon generation, but how accurate can it be?  I want you to confirm the matter through strict evidentiary techniques.  Go back to the libraries,” said the Qianlong Emperor.
“The libraries were set up on the snowy plain around Fushun.  We have examined the records, your Majesty, and perforce must present the following verdict: the story of Four Ancestors does not exist before the time of the Shunzhi Emperor.”
“What!”
“Therefore the story of Four Ancestors was invented by the Shunzhi Emperor.”
“Do you know that the penalty for failing to adhere to strict evidentiary methods is death!”
“Your Majesty, the strictest evidentiary criteria were applied during the whole process of re-examination.”
“And what do the records before the time of the Shunzhi Emperor say about the original Qing ancestors?”
“The records before the time of the Shunzhi Emperor speak of only one Qing ancestor.  His name was Bikuri Yungson, and he was not a man.  He was a mountain spirit.”
“Hmm, I wonder who is buried in the Four Ancestral Tombs at Yongling then.  Go back and re-examine the records from Hung Taiji’s reign and Nurgaci’s reign.  Go to the source!”
“Your Majesty, further re-examination will be difficult.  The records before the time of the Shunzhi Emperor are written in an early form of Manchu that is difficult to understand, and the records before the time of the Purity Accomplished Emperor are written in a defunct Mongolian dialect wholly indecipherable to us.  There is no mention of ‘Manchu’ or ‘Qing’ until the ninth year of the reign of the Purity Accomplished Emperor.”
“Then we will bring in an interpreter.”
Just then, the Lord of Arrows whom the Emperor had sent on a mission to Odori burst into court with the heads of the hundred delegates strung behind him on a rope.  His eyes had been gouged out and his arms cut off.
“The Jurchen tribes around Odori no longer consider us their ancestral brothers,” he said.
“What!  How so?”
“They say they we are not true Jin.  They say they are the true Jin.”
“Tell them our ancestors came from these mountains, in the region around Odori.  Tell them our ancestor is Bikuri Yungson.  They ought to recognize that name.”
“They say that the Jurchen of Odori are not Jin Jurchen, but rather Jianzhou Jurchen.  The true Jin Jurchen come from farther east in Jilin, they say.  As for Bikuri Yungson, they recognized the name, but said that he is a sacred mountain, not far from Mount Changbai, and not a person.”
With these words the Lord of Arrows collapsed before the sedan throne and died.
The Qianlong Emperor said: “Then there are no Jin among the Jurchen tribes from Heilongjiang to Jilin.  Qing are originally Manchu, Manchu are originally Later Jin, Later Jin are originally Jurchen.  Jurchen are originally Early Jin.”
The envoys from the Yi Kingdom to the south were dismissed.
